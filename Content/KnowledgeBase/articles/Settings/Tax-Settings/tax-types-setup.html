<h3>Understanding Tax Types</h3>

</ul>

<h4>SGST (State Goods and Services Tax)</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Applied on intra-state transactions</li>
    <li>Collected by the State Government</li>
    <li>Used along with CGST for intra-state transactions</li>
</ul>

<h4>IGST (Integrated Goods and Services Tax)</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Applied on inter-state (between different states) transactions</li>
    <li>Collected by the Central Government</li>
    <li>Used when supplier and customer are in different states</li>
</ul>

<h4>UTGST (Union Territory Goods and Services Tax)</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Applied on transactions within Union Territories</li>
    <li>Similar to SGST but for Union Territories</li>
    <li>Used along with CGST for intra-UT transactions</li>
</ul>

<h4>CESS (Cess)</h4>
