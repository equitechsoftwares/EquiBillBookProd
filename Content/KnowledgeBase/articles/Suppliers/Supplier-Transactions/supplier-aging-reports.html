    <li><strong>31-60 Days:</strong> Due date was 31-60 days ago</li>
    <li>And so on for other categories</li>

<h4>Aging Based on Bill Date</h4>
<p>Alternative method (less common):</p>
<ul>
    <li>Aging is calculated from the purchase bill date</li>
    <li>Useful when due dates are not tracked</li>
    <li>Less accurate for payment planning</li>
