<h3>Managing Recurring Expenses</h3>
<p>After creating recurring expenses, you can:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>View List:</strong> See all active recurring expenses</li>

<h3>How Recurring Expenses Work</h3>
<p>The system automatically:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Creates expense records based on the schedule</li>
    <li>Uses the template details for each created expense</li>
    <li>Sets the expense date based on the recurrence schedule</li>
    <li>Continues creating expenses until the end date (if set)</li>
    <li>Stops when the end date is reached or when manually stopped</li>
</ul>

<h3>Editing Individual Recurring Expense Instances</h3>
<p>When an expense is created from a recurring template:</p>
<ul>
    <li>You can edit individual expense records if amounts or details change</li>
    <li>Changes to individual records don't affect the template</li>
    <li>The recurring template continues to create new expenses with original values</li>
    <li>Update the template if the change should apply to future expenses</li>
</ul>

<h3>Updating Recurring Expense Templates</h3>
<p>To update a recurring expense:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Open the recurring expense template</li>
    <li>Modify details like amount, category, account, etc.</li>
    <li>Changes apply to future expense records created from the template</li>
    <li>Existing expense records are not affected</li>
    <li>Save the updated template</li>
</ul>
