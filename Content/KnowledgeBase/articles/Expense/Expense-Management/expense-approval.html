<h2>Expense Approval</h2>
<p>Expense approval workflows help maintain control over business spending and ensure proper authorization for expenses in EquiBillBook. This guide explains how expense approval works and how to use it effectively.</p>

<h3>What is Expense Approval?</h3>
<p>Expense approval is a process where expenses need to be reviewed and approved by authorized personnel before they are finalized or paid. This helps businesses maintain spending controls, prevent unauthorized expenses, and ensure compliance with company policies.</p>

<h3>Understanding Approval Workflows</h3>
<p>Expense approval workflows typically involve:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Submission:</strong> Expenses are created and submitted by users</li>
    <li><strong>Review:</strong> Authorized approvers review the expense details</li>
    <li><strong>Approval/Rejection:</strong> Approvers either approve or reject the expense</li>
    <li><strong>Status Tracking:</strong> Track the approval status of each expense</li>
</ul>

<h3>Expense Approval Status</h3>
<p>Expenses can have different approval statuses:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Pending:</strong> Expense is submitted and awaiting approval</li>
    <li><strong>Approved:</strong> Expense has been approved by the authorized person</li>
    <li><strong>Rejected:</strong> Expense has been rejected (may include rejection reason)</li>
    <li><strong>Draft:</strong> Expense is saved but not yet submitted for approval</li>
</ul>

<h3>Submitting Expenses for Approval</h3>
<p>When creating an expense that requires approval:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Create the expense record with all required details</li>
    <li>Attach necessary supporting documents (receipts, invoices)</li>
    <li>Add clear descriptions and notes</li>
    <li>Click <strong>"Submit for Approval"</strong> or <strong>"Save and Submit"</strong></li>
    <li>The expense status changes to "Pending"</li>
    <li>Approvers will be notified (if notification system is configured)</li>
</ol>

<h3>Approving Expenses</h3>
<p>If you are an approver:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Navigate to expenses pending approval (may be in a separate section or filtered view)</li>

            <li>Check the amount and calculations</li>
            <li>Review attached documents</li>
            <li>Verify the expense category and account</li>
            <li>Check if the expense complies with company policies</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Take action:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Approve:</strong> Click "Approve" to approve the expense</li>
            <li><strong>Reject:</strong> Click "Reject" and provide a reason if rejecting</li>
            <li><strong>Request More Information:</strong> If needed, request additional details</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>

<h3>Rejecting Expenses</h3>

</ul>

<h3>Approval Levels</h3>
<p>Some businesses may have multi-level approval:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Single Level:</strong> One approver reviews and approves</li>
    <li><strong>Multi-Level:</strong> Multiple approvers review in sequence (e.g., Manager → Finance → CFO)</li>
    <li><strong>Amount-Based:</strong> Different approval levels based on expense amount</li>
