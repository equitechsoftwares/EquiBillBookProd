<h2>Payment Due Tracking</h2>
<p>Payment due tracking helps you monitor when supplier payments are due, identify overdue payments, and manage your accounts payable effectively. EquiBillBook provides various tools and reports to track payment due dates and ensure timely payments to suppliers.</p>

<h3>What is Payment Due Tracking?</h3>
<p>Payment due tracking is the process of monitoring purchase bills and their payment due dates to ensure payments are made on time. It helps you avoid late payment penalties, maintain good supplier relationships, and manage cash flow effectively.</p>

<h3>Understanding Payment Terms and Due Dates</h3>
<p>Payment due dates are typically calculated based on:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Payment Terms:</strong> Terms agreed with suppliers (e.g., Net 30, Net 15, Due on Receipt)</li>
    <li><strong>Purchase Bill Date:</strong> The date when the purchase bill was created</li>
    <li><strong>Due Date Calculation:</strong> Bill date + Payment terms = Due date</li>
</ul>
<p>Common payment terms:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Due on Receipt:</strong> Payment due immediately</li>
    <li><strong>Net 15:</strong> Payment due within 15 days</li>
    <li><strong>Net 30:</strong> Payment due within 30 days</li>
    <li><strong>Net 45/60/90:</strong> Payment due within specified days</li>
</ul>

<h3>Payment Status Indicators</h3>

<h3>Aging Analysis Report</h3>
