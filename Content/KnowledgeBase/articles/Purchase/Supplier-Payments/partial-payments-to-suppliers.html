<h2>Partial Payments to Suppliers</h2>
<p>Partial payments allow you to record payments that are less than the full purchase bill amount. This is common when you make installment payments or when you pay suppliers in installments for large purchases. EquiBillBook provides flexible options for managing partial payments to suppliers.</p>

<h3>What are Partial Payments to Suppliers?</h3>
<p>A partial payment to a supplier is a payment that covers only a portion of the total purchase bill amount. When you record a partial payment, the purchase bill status changes to "Partially Paid" and the remaining balance continues to show as outstanding until fully paid.</p>

<h3>When to Use Partial Payments to Suppliers</h3>
<p>Partial payments to suppliers are useful in various scenarios:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Making installment payments for large purchase bills</li>
    <li>Down payments or advance payments on orders</li>
    <li>Payments that don't cover the full bill amount due to quality issues or adjustments</li>
    <li>Progressive payments for long-term supply contracts</li>
    <li>Managing cash flow by paying what you can afford at the moment</li>
</ul>

<h3>Recording a Partial Payment to Supplier</h3>

    <li>Select the supplier who is receiving the payment</li>
</ol>

<h4>Step 2: Select Purchase Bill and Enter Partial Amount</h4>
<p>When allocating the payment:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Select the purchase bill you want to apply the payment to</li>
    <li>Enter the partial payment amount (less than the purchase bill total)</li>
    <li>The system will display the purchase bill total and outstanding balance</li>
    <li>Enter the amount you're paying in the payment field</li>
</ul>

<h4>Step 3: Complete Payment Details</h4>
<p>Fill in the remaining payment information:</p>

</ol>

<h3>Purchase Bill Status with Partial Payments</h3>
<p>After recording a partial payment:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The purchase bill status changes to <strong>"Partially Paid"</strong></li>
    <li>The outstanding balance is updated to show the remaining amount due</li>
    <li>The purchase bill remains in accounts payable until fully paid</li>
    <li>You can apply additional payments to the same purchase bill until it's fully paid</li>
</ul>

<h3>Applying Multiple Partial Payments</h3>
<p>You can apply multiple partial payments to the same purchase bill:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Record the first partial payment as described above</li>
    <li>When you make another payment, select the same purchase bill again</li>
    <li>Enter the new payment amount</li>
    <li>The system will show the remaining balance and apply the new payment</li>
    <li>Continue until the purchase bill is fully paid</li>
</ol>

<h3>Allocating Partial Payment Across Multiple Purchase Bills</h3>
<p>You can also split a single payment across multiple purchase bills:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Select multiple purchase bills from the outstanding bills list</li>
    <li>Enter the payment amount for each purchase bill</li>
    <li>Ensure the total allocated amount equals the total payment made</li>
    <li>Each purchase bill will be updated with its respective partial payment</li>
</ol>
