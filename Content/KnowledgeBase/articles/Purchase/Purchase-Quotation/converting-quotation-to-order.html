<h2>Converting Quotation to Order</h2>
<p>Once you've reviewed and accepted a purchase quotation from a supplier, you can easily convert it into a purchase order. This feature saves time and ensures accuracy by transferring all quotation details automatically.</p>

<h3>When to Convert a Purchase Quotation</h3>
<p>Convert a purchase quotation when:</p>
<ul>
    <li>You've reviewed and accepted the supplier's quotation</li>

    <li>The quotation terms and prices are acceptable</li>

</ul>

<h3>Prerequisites for Conversion</h3>
<p>Before converting, ensure:</p>
<ul>

    <li>All quotation details are correct and verified</li>
    <li>The supplier information is accurate</li>
    <li>Items, quantities, and prices are as expected</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step-by-Step Conversion Process</h3>

<h4>Step 1: Open the Purchase Quotation</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Navigate to <strong>Purchase</strong> → <strong>Purchase Quotation</strong></li>
    <li>Find and open the quotation you want to convert</li>
    <li>Review the quotation details to ensure everything is correct</li>
    <li>Ensure the quotation status is "Accepted" (you may need to update the status first)</li>
</ol>

<h4>Step 2: Update Quotation Status (if needed)</h4>
<p>If the quotation is not yet marked as "Accepted":</p>
<ol>
    <li>Click on the status dropdown or action menu</li>
    <li>Select <strong>"Mark as Accepted"</strong> or <strong>"Accept Quotation"</strong></li>
    <li>Confirm the status change</li>
</ol>

<h4>Step 3: Convert to Purchase Order</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Click the <strong>"Convert to Purchase Order"</strong> button or link</li>
    <li>This option is available in the action menu when the quotation status is "Accepted"</li>
    <li>The system will open the Purchase Order creation page with all quotation details pre-filled</li>
</ol>

<h4>Step 4: Review the Created Purchase Order</h4>
<p>After conversion, review the purchase order:</p>
<ul>
    <li>All supplier details are copied from the quotation</li>
    <li>All items, quantities, and prices are transferred</li>
    <li>Tax calculations are preserved</li>
    <li>Terms and conditions are copied</li>
    <li>Shipping details are included</li>
    <li>A new purchase order number is generated</li>

<h4>Step 5: Modify if Necessary</h4>
<p>You can make adjustments to the purchase order:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Add or remove items if needed</li>
    <li>Adjust quantities</li>
    <li>Modify prices (though this should match the quotation)</li>
    <li>Update terms and conditions</li>
    <li>Change shipping details</li>
    <li>Add notes or special instructions</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Changes made to the purchase order do not affect the original quotation.</p>

<h4>Step 6: Save the Purchase Order</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Review all details one final time</li>
    <li>Click <strong>"Save"</strong> to create the purchase order</li>
    <li>The quotation status will be updated to reflect the conversion</li>
    <li>The purchase order is now ready for processing</li>
</ol>

<h3>What Gets Transferred During Conversion?</h3>

<h3>Alternative: Converting Directly to Purchase Bill</h3>

    <li>Save the purchase bill</li>
</ol>

<h4>When to Use Direct Conversion</h4>
<ul>
    <li>When you've already received the goods/services</li>
    <li>When you want to record the purchase immediately</li>
    <li>When order tracking is not necessary</li>
    <li>For immediate billing and accounting purposes</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conversion Status Tracking</h3>
<p>The purchase quotation status helps you track its lifecycle:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Draft:</strong> Quotation is being prepared</li>
    <li><strong>Sent:</strong> Quotation has been sent to the supplier</li>
    <li><strong>Accepted:</strong> Quotation has been accepted (ready for conversion)</li>
    <li><strong>Declined:</strong> Quotation has been declined or rejected</li>
    <li><strong>Converted to Order:</strong> Quotation has been converted to a purchase order</li>
    <li><strong>Converted to Bill:</strong> Quotation has been converted to a purchase bill</li>
</ul>

<h3>Best Practices</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Always review the converted purchase order before finalizing</li>
    <li>Verify that all items and prices match the quotation</li>
    <li>Ensure quantities are correct before converting</li>
    <li>Update quotation status appropriately to maintain accurate records</li>
    <li>Keep the original quotation for reference and audit purposes</li>

</ul>

<h3>Common Scenarios</h3>

<h4>Scenario 3: Partial Conversion</h4>
<p>If you only need part of a quotation:</p>
<ul>

    <li>Or create a new quotation with only the required items first</li>
</ul>
