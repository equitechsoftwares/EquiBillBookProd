    <li>Select a different supplier (Supplier B, C, etc.)</li>
    <li>Add the same items with their respective prices</li>
    <li>Use the same reference number or a clear identifier to group related quotations</li>
    <li>Repeat for each supplier you want to compare</li>
</ol>

<h3>Comparing Quotations</h3>
<p>Once you have multiple quotations, use these strategies to compare them:</p>
