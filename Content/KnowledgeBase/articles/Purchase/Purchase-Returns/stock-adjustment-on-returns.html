<h2>Stock Adjustment on Returns</h2>
<p>When you create a purchase return in EquiBillBook, the system automatically adjusts your inventory stock levels. This guide explains how stock adjustments work during purchase returns and how to ensure accurate inventory management.</p>

<h3>Automatic Stock Adjustment</h3>
<p>When a purchase return is created and finalized:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Stock Deduction:</strong> Returned quantities are automatically deducted from inventory</li>
    <li><strong>Location-specific:</strong> Stock is adjusted at the branch/location where the purchase was received</li>
    <li><strong>Real-time Update:</strong> Stock levels are updated immediately upon finalizing the return</li>
    <li><strong>History Tracking:</strong> All stock movements are recorded in stock history</li>
</ul>

<h3>How Stock Adjustment Works</h3>
<p>The stock adjustment process follows these steps:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Item Selection:</strong> When you select items for return, the system identifies the stock locations</li>
    <li><strong>Quantity Validation:</strong> System verifies that sufficient stock exists for return</li>
    <li><strong>Stock Deduction:</strong> Upon finalizing the return, quantities are deducted from inventory</li>
    <li><strong>Purchase Details Update:</strong> Quantity remaining and quantity sold are updated in purchase details</li>
    <li><strong>Branch Stock Update:</strong> Item branch mapping is updated with new quantities</li>
    <li><strong>History Recording:</strong> Stock movement is recorded in stock history</li>
</ol>

<h3>Stock Tracking Requirements</h3>
<p>For stock adjustment to occur:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Stock Tracking Enabled:</strong> Stock tracking must be enabled for the items being returned</li>
    <li><strong>Item Configuration:</strong> Items must have stock tracking configured in item settings</li>
    <li><strong>Return Status:</strong> Return must be in "Final" status (Draft returns don't adjust stock)</li>
    <li><strong>Valid Purchase:</strong> The original purchase must have stock tracking enabled</li>
</ul>

<h3>Quantity Calculations</h3>
<p>The system handles quantity calculations carefully:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Return Quantity:</strong> Only the returned quantity is deducted from stock</li>
    <li><strong>Unit Conversion:</strong> Quantities are converted based on item unit of measurement</li>
    <li><strong>Free Quantity:</strong> Free quantities from purchase are also adjusted if applicable</li>
    <li><strong>Partial Returns:</strong> Only the specific returned quantities are deducted</li>
</ul>

<h3>Multi-location Stock Adjustment</h3>
<p>For businesses with multiple branches:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Branch-specific:</strong> Stock is adjusted at the branch where the purchase was received</li>
    <li><strong>Location Tracking:</strong> Each branch maintains separate stock levels</li>
    <li><strong>Inter-branch Returns:</strong> Returns are processed at the original purchase branch</li>
    <li><strong>Stock Reports:</strong> Branch-wise stock reports reflect the adjustments</li>
</ul>

<h3>Purchase Details Update</h3>
<p>When stock is adjusted, purchase details are updated:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Quantity Remaining:</strong> The quantity remaining for purchase items is increased</li>
    <li><strong>Quantity Sold:</strong> The quantity sold is decreased by the return amount</li>
    <li><strong>Stock Reconciliation:</strong> Purchase details maintain accurate stock tracking</li>
    <li><strong>Item Mapping:</strong> Item branch mapping quantities are updated</li>
</ul>

<h3>Draft vs Final Status</h3>
<p>Stock adjustment behavior differs by status:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Draft Status:</strong> No stock adjustment occurs - allows you to prepare returns without affecting inventory</li>
    <li><strong>Final Status:</strong> Stock is immediately adjusted when the return is finalized</li>
    <li><strong>Status Change:</strong> Moving from Draft to Final triggers stock adjustment</li>
    <li><strong>Cancellation:</strong> Cancelling a Final return restores the stock</li>
</ul>

<h3>Stock History</h3>
<p>All stock adjustments are recorded in stock history:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Movement Type:</strong> Recorded as "Purchase Return" in stock history</li>
    <li><strong>Reference:</strong> Linked to the purchase return document</li>
    <li><strong>Details:</strong> Includes item, quantity, date, branch, and reason</li>
    <li><strong>Audit Trail:</strong> Provides complete audit trail for inventory movements</li>
</ul>

<h3>Stock Restoration on Cancellation</h3>
<p>If you cancel a purchase return:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Automatic Restoration:</strong> Stock that was deducted is automatically restored</li>
    <li><strong>Quantity Updates:</strong> Purchase details quantities are restored</li>
    <li><strong>Branch Stock:</strong> Branch stock levels are restored</li>
    <li><strong>History Entry:</strong> A new history entry records the restoration</li>
</ul>

<h3>Verifying Stock Adjustments</h3>
<p>To verify that stock was adjusted correctly:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Check the current stock levels for returned items</li>
    <li>Review stock history for the purchase return entry</li>
    <li>Verify purchase details show updated quantities</li>
    <li>Check branch stock reports if using multi-location</li>
    <li>Compare stock levels before and after the return</li>
</ol>

<h3>Stock Adjustment Reports</h3>
<p>Monitor stock adjustments through reports:</p>

<h3>Common Scenarios</h3>
<p><strong>Scenario 1: Full Item Return</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Returning all quantities of an item deducts the full quantity from stock</li>
    <li>Quantity remaining in purchase details is restored to original</li>
    <li>Item branch mapping reflects the deduction</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Scenario 2: Partial Item Return</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Returning partial quantities deducts only the returned amount</li>
    <li>Remaining stock reflects the partial deduction</li>
    <li>Purchase details show updated quantities</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Scenario 3: Multiple Items Return</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Each item's stock is adjusted independently</li>
    <li>All adjustments occur in a single transaction</li>
    <li>Stock history shows separate entries for each item</li>
</ul>

<h3>Best Practices</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Always verify stock levels before creating purchase returns</li>
    <li>Use Draft status to prepare returns without affecting stock</li>
    <li>Review stock adjustments after finalizing returns</li>
    <li>Keep stock tracking enabled for accurate inventory management</li>
    <li>Regularly reconcile stock levels with physical inventory</li>
    <li>Monitor stock history for unusual adjustments</li>
    <li>Ensure return quantities don't exceed available stock</li>
</ul>

<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
