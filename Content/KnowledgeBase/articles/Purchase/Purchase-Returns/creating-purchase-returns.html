</ol>

<h3>Return Details</h3>

<h3>Calculations and Adjustments</h3>
<p>The system automatically calculates:</p>

    <li><strong>Discount:</strong> Any applicable discounts (if the original purchase had discounts, they are typically adjusted proportionally)</li>

</ul>

<h3>Stock Adjustment</h3>
<p>When you create a purchase return:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If stock tracking is enabled, the returned quantities are automatically deducted from inventory</li>
    <li>Stock is adjusted from the location/branch where the purchase was received</li>
    <li>The stock movement is recorded in the stock history</li>
    <li>This helps maintain accurate inventory levels</li>
    <li>Quantity remaining and quantity sold are updated in purchase details</li>
</ul>

<h3>Debit Note Generation</h3>
<p>A debit note is automatically generated when you create a purchase return:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Debit Note Number:</strong> The system generates a unique debit note number</li>
    <li><strong>Linked to Purchase:</strong> The debit note is linked to the original purchase bill</li>
    <li><strong>Supplier Debit:</strong> The supplier's account is debited with the return amount</li>
    <li><strong>Print/Email:</strong> You can print or email the debit note to the supplier</li>
    <li><strong>Payment Adjustment:</strong> The debit note can be used to adjust supplier payments</li>
</ul>

<h3>Saving the Purchase Return</h3>

</ol>

<h3>Return Status</h3>
<p>Purchase returns can have different statuses:</p>
<ul>

    <li><strong>Final:</strong> Return has been processed, debit note issued, and stock adjusted</li>
    <li><strong>Cancelled:</strong> Return has been cancelled (stock is restored if it was adjusted)</li>
</ul>

<h3>After Creating a Purchase Return</h3>
