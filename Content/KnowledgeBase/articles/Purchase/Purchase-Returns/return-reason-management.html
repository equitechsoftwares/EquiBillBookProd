</ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The exact location may vary based on your system configuration. Contact support if you cannot find return reason settings.</p>

<h3>Selecting Return Reason During Return</h3>
<p>When creating a purchase return:</p>
<ol>
    <li>After selecting items to return, you'll see a return reason field</li>
