<h2>Creating Purchase Orders</h2>
<p>Purchase Orders (PO) in EquiBillBook allow you to record orders placed with suppliers before receiving goods or services. This helps you track pending purchases, manage inventory expectations, and maintain a clear workflow from order placement to bill receipt.</p>

<h3>What is a Purchase Order?</h3>
<p>A Purchase Order is a formal document sent to a supplier indicating the types, quantities, and agreed prices for products or services. It serves as a commitment to purchase and helps both parties track the order through fulfillment.</p>
