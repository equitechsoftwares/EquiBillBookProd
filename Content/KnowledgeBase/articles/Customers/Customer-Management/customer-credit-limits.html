<h2>Customer Credit Limits</h2>
<p>Credit limits help you manage the maximum credit amount you're willing to extend to customers, preventing over-exposure to credit risk. This guide explains how to set up and manage customer credit limits in EquiBillBook.</p>

<h3>What is a Credit Limit?</h3>
<p>A credit limit is the maximum amount of credit (outstanding balance) that you allow a customer to have at any given time. When a customer's outstanding balance reaches the credit limit, you may restrict further sales on credit until payments are received.</p>

<h3>Why Set Credit Limits?</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Risk Management:</strong> Protect your business from excessive credit exposure</li>
    <li><strong>Cash Flow:</strong> Ensure timely payments and better cash flow management</li>
    <li><strong>Customer Management:</strong> Encourage customers to make payments on time</li>
    <li><strong>Financial Control:</strong> Set appropriate credit limits based on customer relationship and payment history</li>
</ul>

<h3>Setting Credit Limits for Customers</h3>
<p>To set a credit limit for a customer:</p>

<h4>While Creating a Customer</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Go to <strong>Customers</strong> → <strong>Add Customer</strong></li>
    <li>Scroll to the <strong>Financial Settings</strong> section</li>
    <li>Enter the credit limit amount in the <strong>"Credit Limit"</strong> field</li>
    <li>Enter 0 if you don't want to set a limit, or leave blank for unlimited credit</li>
    <li>Save the customer</li>
</ol>

<h4>Editing Existing Customers</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Go to <strong>Customers</strong> → <strong>Customer List</strong></li>
    <li>Find and edit the customer</li>
    <li>Navigate to the <strong>Credit Limit</strong> field</li>
    <li>Enter or update the credit limit amount</li>
    <li>Save the changes</li>
</ol>

<h3>Understanding Credit Limit Values</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Zero (0):</strong> No credit allowed - customer must pay upfront</li>
    <li><strong>Positive Amount:</strong> Maximum credit allowed (e.g., 50000 means customer can have up to ₹50,000 outstanding)</li>
    <li><strong>Blank/Unlimited:</strong> No credit limit restriction (use with caution)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Factors to Consider When Setting Credit Limits</h3>
<p>Consider these factors when determining appropriate credit limits:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Payment History:</strong> Customers with good payment history can have higher limits</li>
    <li><strong>Business Relationship:</strong> Long-term customers may warrant higher limits</li>
    <li><strong>Customer Type:</strong> Corporate customers might have higher limits than retail customers</li>
    <li><strong>Business Size:</strong> Larger businesses can typically handle higher credit amounts</li>
    <li><strong>Risk Assessment:</strong> Evaluate the financial stability of the customer</li>
    <li><strong>Industry Standards:</strong> Consider typical credit terms in your industry</li>
</ul>

<h3>Credit Limit Enforcement</h3>
<p>When credit limits are set, the system may:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Warn on Invoice Creation:</strong> Show a warning when creating invoices that would exceed the limit</li>
    <li><strong>Prevent Credit Sales:</strong> Block creation of credit invoices when limit is exceeded</li>
    <li><strong>Display Current Balance:</strong> Show current outstanding balance vs. credit limit</li>
    <li><strong>Credit Available:</strong> Display remaining credit available (limit minus current balance)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The exact behavior depends on your system configuration and settings.</p>

<h3>Monitoring Credit Limits</h3>
<p>Regularly monitor customer credit usage:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Customer Statements:</strong> Review customer statements to see outstanding balances</li>
    <li><strong>Credit Reports:</strong> Generate reports showing customers near or exceeding limits</li>
    <li><strong>Dashboard Alerts:</strong> Some systems show alerts for customers approaching limits</li>
    <li><strong>Outstanding Reports:</strong> Review accounts receivable reports to identify high-risk customers</li>
</ul>

<h3>Updating Credit Limits</h3>
<p>You may need to update credit limits based on:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Improved Payment History:</strong> Increase limits for customers with consistent payments</li>
    <li><strong>Increased Business:</strong> Adjust limits as business relationships grow</li>
    <li><strong>Payment Issues:</strong> Reduce limits for customers with payment delays</li>
    <li><strong>Seasonal Changes:</strong> Adjust limits based on seasonal business patterns</li>
</ul>

<h3>Credit Limit Best Practices</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Start Conservative:</strong> Begin with lower limits for new customers</li>
    <li><strong>Review Regularly:</strong> Periodically review and adjust limits based on performance</li>
    <li><strong>Document Decisions:</strong> Keep records of why specific limits were set</li>
    <li><strong>Communicate Clearly:</strong> Inform customers about their credit limits and terms</li>
    <li><strong>Monitor Closely:</strong> Watch customers approaching limits and follow up proactively</li>
    <li><strong>Establish Policies:</strong> Create clear policies for credit limit approval and updates</li>
</ul>

<h3>Credit Limit vs. Payment Terms</h3>
<p>Credit limits and payment terms work together:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Credit Limit:</strong> Maximum outstanding amount allowed</li>
    <li><strong>Payment Terms:</strong> Time period within which payment is expected (e.g., Net 30, Net 60)</li>
    <li>Both should be considered when managing customer credit</li>
</ul>

<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
<p><strong>Customer Cannot Make Purchase:</strong> Check if credit limit is set to 0 or if outstanding balance exceeds the limit. Review customer's payment status and consider adjusting the limit if appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>Credit Limit Not Working:</strong> Verify that credit limit enforcement is enabled in settings, check that the limit is set correctly (not blank), and ensure the system is calculating outstanding balance correctly.</p>
