<h2>Customer Activation/Deactivation</h2>
<p>Activating and deactivating customers allows you to control which customers are available for transactions without deleting their records. This is useful for managing inactive customers, temporary suspensions, or maintaining historical data. This guide explains how to activate and deactivate customers in EquiBillBook.</p>

<h3>What is Customer Activation/Deactivation?</h3>
<p>Customer activation status determines whether a customer can be used in transactions:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Active Customers:</strong> Can be selected in invoices, quotations, orders, and other transactions</li>
    <li><strong>Inactive Customers:</strong> Cannot be selected in new transactions but their records and history are preserved</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why Deactivate Customers?</h3>
<p>Common reasons to deactivate customers:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Inactive Customers:</strong> Customers who haven't made purchases in a long time</li>
    <li><strong>Temporary Suspension:</strong> Temporarily prevent transactions (payment issues, disputes)</li>
    <li><strong>Business Closure:</strong> Customer's business has closed</li>
    <li><strong>Data Cleanup:</strong> Remove from active selection without losing history</li>
    <li><strong>Credit Issues:</strong> Suspend due to payment problems</li>
</ul>

<h3>Activating a Customer</h3>
<p>To activate a customer (make them available for transactions):</p>

<h4>Method 1: During Customer Creation</h4>
<ul>
    <li>When creating a new customer, the status is set to <strong>Active</strong> by default</li>
    <li>You can uncheck the "Active" option if you want to create an inactive customer</li>
</ul>

<h4>Method 2: Editing Existing Customer</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Go to <strong>Customers</strong> → <strong>Customer List</strong></li>
    <li>Find the inactive customer you want to activate</li>
    <li>Click <strong>"Edit"</strong> or click on the customer name</li>
    <li>Find the <strong>"Status"</strong> or <strong>"Active"</strong> checkbox/option</li>
    <li>Check the <strong>"Active"</strong> option or select <strong>"Active"</strong> from status dropdown</li>
    <li>Click <strong>"Update"</strong> or <strong>"Save"</strong></li>
</ol>

<h4>Method 3: Bulk Activation</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Select multiple inactive customers from the list</li>
    <li>Use the bulk action option to activate all selected customers</li>
    <li>Confirm the activation</li>
</ul>

<h3>Deactivating a Customer</h3>
<p>To deactivate a customer (remove from active selection):</p>

<h4>Method 1: Edit Customer</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Go to <strong>Customers</strong> → <strong>Customer List</strong></li>
    <li>Find the customer you want to deactivate</li>
    <li>Click <strong>"Edit"</strong> or click on the customer name</li>
    <li>Find the <strong>"Status"</strong> or <strong>"Active"</strong> checkbox/option</li>
    <li>Uncheck the <strong>"Active"</strong> option or select <strong>"Inactive"</strong> from status dropdown</li>
    <li>Click <strong>"Update"</strong> or <strong>"Save"</strong></li>
</ol>

<h4>Method 2: Quick Deactivation</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Some systems have a quick action button (toggle switch) in the customer list</li>
    <li>Click the status toggle to quickly activate/deactivate</li>
</ul>

<h4>Method 3: Bulk Deactivation</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Select multiple customers from the list</li>
    <li>Use the bulk action option to deactivate all selected customers</li>
    <li>Confirm the deactivation</li>
</ul>

<h3>Effects of Deactivation</h3>
<p>When a customer is deactivated:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>New Transactions:</strong> Customer cannot be selected in new invoices, quotations, orders, etc.</li>
    <li><strong>Existing Data:</strong> All historical data (invoices, payments, statements) remains intact</li>
    <li><strong>Reports:</strong> Customer data still appears in historical reports</li>
    <li><strong>Outstanding Balances:</strong> Outstanding balances remain and can still be viewed</li>
    <li><strong>Payment Recording:</strong> Payments can still be recorded against outstanding invoices</li>
</ul>

<h3>Viewing Active vs. Inactive Customers</h3>
<p>Customer lists typically have filters to view:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>All Customers:</strong> Shows both active and inactive</li>
    <li><strong>Active Only:</strong> Shows only active customers (default view)</li>
    <li><strong>Inactive Only:</strong> Shows only inactive customers</li>
</ul>
<p>Use filters to manage and review customer status.</p>

<h3>Reactivating Customers</h3>
<p>To reactivate a previously deactivated customer:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Filter the customer list to show "Inactive" customers</li>
    <li>Find the customer you want to reactivate</li>
    <li>Edit the customer and set status to "Active"</li>
    <li>Save the changes</li>
    <li>The customer will immediately be available for new transactions</li>
</ol>

<h3>Best Practices</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Regular Review:</strong> Periodically review customer list and deactivate truly inactive customers</li>
    <li><strong>Document Reason:</strong> Use the notes field to document why a customer was deactivated</li>
    <li><strong>Clear Outstanding:</strong> Consider clearing outstanding balances before deactivating (or keep for records)</li>
    <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Inform customers before deactivating if there are outstanding issues</li>
    <li><strong>Don't Delete:</strong> Use deactivation instead of deletion to preserve historical data</li>
    <li><strong>Bulk Operations:</strong> Use bulk activation/deactivation for efficiency when managing multiple customers</li>
</ul>

<h3>Deactivation vs. Deletion</h3>
<p>Important differences:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Deactivation:</strong> Hides customer from active selection, preserves all data and history</li>
    <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> Permanently removes customer record (usually not recommended)</li>
    <li><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Always use deactivation instead of deletion to maintain data integrity</li>
</ul>

<h3>Special Considerations</h3>
<p>Before deactivating, consider:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Outstanding Invoices:</strong> Customer may still have unpaid invoices</li>
    <li><strong>Future Transactions:</strong> Ensure no future transactions are planned</li>
    <li><strong>Reporting:</strong> Deactivated customers may be excluded from some reports by default</li>
    <li><strong>Related Records:</strong> Check if customer is linked to other records (recurring invoices, etc.)</li>
</ul>
