<h2>Customer Tax Information</h2>
<p>Accurate tax information for customers is essential for proper tax calculations, compliance, and generating correct invoices. This guide explains how to configure customer tax settings in EquiBillBook.</p>

<h3>Why Tax Information Matters</h3>

<ul>
    <li>How taxes are calculated on invoices</li>
    <li>Which tax rates apply to transactions</li>
    <li>Tax compliance and reporting requirements</li>
    <li>Place of supply for tax calculations (important for GST/VAT)</li>
    <li>Tax exemption eligibility</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tax Preference</h3>
<p>Tax preference indicates the customer's tax status:</p>

<h4>Taxable</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Customer is subject to taxes</li>
    <li>Taxes will be calculated and applied to invoices</li>
    <li>Most common option for regular customers</li>
</ul>

    <li>Used for tax-exempt organizations, exports, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Non-Taxable</h4>

<h3>Tax Exemption</h3>
