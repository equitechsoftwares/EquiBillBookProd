<h2>Customer Payment Terms</h2>
<p>Payment terms define when and how customers are expected to pay for their purchases. Setting appropriate payment terms helps manage cash flow and establishes clear expectations with customers. This guide explains how to configure and use payment terms in EquiBillBook.</p>

<h3>What are Payment Terms?</h3>
<p>Payment terms specify the time period and conditions under which customers must pay for their purchases. Common examples include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Due on Receipt:</strong> Payment due immediately</li>
    <li><strong>Net 15:</strong> Payment due within 15 days</li>
    <li><strong>Net 30:</strong> Payment due within 30 days</li>
    <li><strong>Net 60:</strong> Payment due within 60 days</li>
    <li><strong>End of Month (EOM):</strong> Payment due at the end of the month</li>
    <li><strong>2/10 Net 30:</strong> 2% discount if paid within 10 days, otherwise net 30 days</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why Set Payment Terms?</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Cash Flow Management:</strong> Predict when payments will be received</li>
    <li><strong>Clear Expectations:</strong> Set clear payment expectations with customers</li>
    <li><strong>Automated Calculations:</strong> System automatically calculates due dates</li>
    <li><strong>Reporting:</strong> Generate reports based on payment terms and due dates</li>
    <li><strong>Payment Reminders:</strong> Send automated reminders based on due dates</li>
</ul>

<h3>Setting Up Payment Terms</h3>
<p>Before assigning payment terms to customers, you need to set up payment terms in the system:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Navigate to <strong>Settings</strong> → <strong>Sales Settings</strong> → <strong>Payment Terms</strong></li>
    <li>Click <strong>"Create New"</strong> or <strong>"Add Payment Term"</strong></li>
    <li>Enter the <strong>Payment Term Name</strong> (e.g., "Net 30", "Due on Receipt")</li>
    <li>Configure the payment term details (days, discount, etc.)</li>
    <li>Save the payment term</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Payment terms are typically set up once by administrators and then assigned to customers.</p>

<h3>Assigning Payment Terms to Customers</h3>
<p>You can assign payment terms to customers in several ways:</p>

<h4>Method 1: While Creating a Customer</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Go to <strong>Customers</strong> → <strong>Add Customer</strong></li>
    <li>In the <strong>Financial Settings</strong> section, find <strong>"Payment Terms"</strong></li>
    <li>Select the appropriate payment term from the dropdown</li>
    <li>Save the customer</li>
</ol>

<h4>Method 2: Editing Existing Customers</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Go to <strong>Customers</strong> → <strong>Customer List</strong></li>
    <li>Find and edit the customer</li>
    <li>Update the <strong>Payment Terms</strong> field</li>
    <li>Save the changes</li>
</ol>

<h4>Method 3: Default Payment Terms</h4>
<ul>
    <li>You can set a default payment term in sales settings</li>
    <li>This will be automatically assigned to new customers if not specified</li>
    <li>You can override the default for specific customers</li>
</ul>

<h3>How Payment Terms Work</h3>
<p>When you create an invoice with a customer that has payment terms assigned:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The system calculates the <strong>Due Date</strong> based on the payment terms</li>
    <li>For example, if payment terms are "Net 30" and invoice date is January 1st, due date will be January 31st</li>
    <li>The due date appears on the invoice and in customer statements</li>
    <li>Overdue invoices are identified based on due dates</li>
</ul>

<h3>Common Payment Term Types</h3>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Due on Receipt:</strong> Payment expected immediately</li>

</ul>
