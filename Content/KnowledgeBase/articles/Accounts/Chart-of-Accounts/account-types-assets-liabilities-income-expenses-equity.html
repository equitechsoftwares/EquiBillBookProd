<h2>Account Types (Assets, Liabilities, Income, Expenses, Equity)</h2>
<p>Understanding account types is fundamental to proper accounting in EquiBillBook. Account types are the major categories that classify all your financial accounts. This guide explains each account type, their characteristics, and how they're used in your accounting system.</p>

<h3>Overview of Account Types</h3>

<h3>Accounting Equation</h3>
<p>These five account types are related by the fundamental accounting equation:</p>
<p><strong>Assets = Liabilities + Equity</strong></p>
<p>Or rearranged:</p>
<p><strong>Equity = Assets - Liabilities</strong></p>
<p>This equation must always balance, which is the foundation of double-entry bookkeeping.</p>

<h3>Account Type Numbering System</h3>
<p>In EquiBillBook, accounts are typically numbered by type:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>1000-1999:</strong> Assets</li>
    <li><strong>2000-2999:</strong> Liabilities</li>
    <li><strong>3000-3999:</strong> Equity</li>
    <li><strong>4000-4999:</strong> Income</li>
    <li><strong>5000-5999:</strong> Expenses</li>
</ul>
<p>This numbering helps organize accounts and makes them easier to find.</p>

<h3>How Account Types Work in EquiBillBook</h3>

<h4>Automatic Account Assignment</h4>
<p>EquiBillBook automatically assigns accounts based on transaction type:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Sales invoices → Income account</li>
    <li>Purchase bills → Expense account</li>
    <li>Payments → Asset account (Bank/Cash)</li>
    <li>Customer receivables → Asset account</li>
    <li>Supplier payables → Liability account</li>
</ul>

<h4>Reports by Account Type</h4>
<p>Financial reports organize accounts by type:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Balance Sheet:</strong> Shows Assets, Liabilities, and Equity</li>
    <li><strong>Profit & Loss:</strong> Shows Income and Expenses</li>
    <li><strong>Trial Balance:</strong> Lists all accounts grouped by type</li>
</ul>

<h3>Creating Accounts by Type</h3>
<p>When creating new accounts:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Select the appropriate account type</li>
    <li>Choose or create a sub-type (if applicable)</li>
    <li>Enter account name and code</li>
    <li>Set opening balance (if needed)</li>
    <li>Activate the account</li>
</ol>

<h3>Best Practices</h3>
