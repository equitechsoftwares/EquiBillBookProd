This guide will help you understand what a Chart of Accounts is and why it's essential for your business.</p>

<h3>What is a Chart of Accounts?</h3>
<p>A Chart of Accounts (COA) is a structured list of all accounts used in your accounting system. Each account represents a specific category of financial transactions and helps organize your business's financial information into meaningful groups.</p>

<p>Think of the Chart of Accounts as a filing system for your financial data - it categorizes all your transactions so you can easily find, analyze, and report on different aspects of your business finances.</p>
