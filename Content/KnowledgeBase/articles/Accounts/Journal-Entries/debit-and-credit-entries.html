<h2>Debit and Credit Entries</h2>
<p>Understanding debit and credit entries is fundamental to accounting and creating accurate journal entries in EquiBillBook. This guide explains the principles of double-entry bookkeeping and how to use debits and credits correctly.</p>

<h3>Understanding Double-Entry Bookkeeping</h3>
<p>Double-entry bookkeeping is the foundation of accounting. Every transaction affects at least two accounts, with one account debited and another credited. The total debits must always equal the total credits.</p>

<h3>What is a Debit?</h3>
<p>A debit entry:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Increases asset accounts (Cash, Inventory, Equipment, etc.)</li>
    <li>Increases expense accounts (Rent, Salaries, Utilities, etc.)</li>
    <li>Decreases liability accounts (Accounts Payable, Loans, etc.)</li>
    <li>Decreases income accounts (Sales, Service Revenue, etc.)</li>
    <li>Decreases equity accounts (Owner's Equity, Retained Earnings, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<h3>What is a Credit?</h3>
<p>A credit entry:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Increases liability accounts (Accounts Payable, Loans, etc.)</li>
    <li>Increases income accounts (Sales, Service Revenue, etc.)</li>
    <li>Increases equity accounts (Owner's Equity, Retained Earnings, etc.)</li>
    <li>Decreases asset accounts (Cash, Inventory, Equipment, etc.)</li>
    <li>Decreases expense accounts (Rent, Salaries, Utilities, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Accounting Equation</h3>
<p>The fundamental accounting equation is:</p>
<p><strong>Assets = Liabilities + Equity</strong></p>
<p>This equation must always balance, which is why debits must equal credits in every journal entry.</p>

<h3>Common Transaction Examples</h3>

<h4>Example 1: Recording a Sale</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Debit:</strong> Cash (Asset increases)</li>

</ul>

<h4>Example 2: Paying an Expense</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Debit:</strong> Rent Expense (Expense increases)</li>
    <li><strong>Credit:</strong> Cash (Asset decreases)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Example 3: Purchasing Equipment on Credit</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Debit:</strong> Equipment (Asset increases)</li>
    <li><strong>Credit:</strong> Accounts Payable (Liability increases)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Example 4: Recording Depreciation</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Debit:</strong> Depreciation Expense (Expense increases)</li>
    <li><strong>Credit:</strong> Accumulated Depreciation (Contra-asset increases)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Example 5: Owner's Investment</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Debit:</strong> Cash (Asset increases)</li>
    <li><strong>Credit:</strong> Owner's Equity (Equity increases)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Creating Balanced Entries</h3>
<p>When creating journal entries in EquiBillBook:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Identify all accounts affected by the transaction</li>
    <li>Determine whether each account increases or decreases</li>
    <li>Apply the debit/credit rules based on account type</li>
    <li>Ensure total debits equal total credits</li>
    <li>Add clear descriptions for each entry</li>
</ol>

<h3>Tips for Using Debits and Credits</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Remember the acronym DEAD:</strong> Debits increase Expenses, Assets, and Drawings</li>
    <li><strong>Remember the acronym CLIC:</strong> Credits increase Liabilities, Income, and Capital</li>
    <li>Always verify that debits equal credits before posting</li>
    <li>Review account types when selecting accounts for entries</li>
    <li>Use the accounting equation to verify entries make sense</li>
    <li>Double-check entries that seem unusual or large amounts</li>
</ul>

<h3>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Mixing up debits and credits for account types</li>
    <li>Creating unbalanced entries (debits ≠ credits)</li>
    <li>Using the wrong account type for transactions</li>
    <li>Forgetting to record both sides of a transaction</li>
    <li>Not understanding the normal balance of accounts</li>
</ul>

<h3>Verifying Entries</h3>
<p>Before posting a journal entry:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Check that total debits equal total credits</li>
    <li>Verify account selections are correct</li>
    <li>Ensure amounts are accurate</li>
    <li>Review descriptions for clarity</li>
    <li>Confirm the entry makes accounting sense</li>
</ul>

    <li><strong>Balance Sheet:</strong> Shows assets, liabilities, and equity balances</li>
    <li><strong>Profit & Loss:</strong> Shows income and expense balances</li>
    <li>All entries flow through to these reports</li>
    <li>Proper debit/credit usage ensures accurate financial reporting</li>
</ul>
