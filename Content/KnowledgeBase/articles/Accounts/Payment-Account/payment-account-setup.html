<h3>Setting Up Payment Accounts</h3>

            <li>Payment clearing accounts (if using payment clearing mechanisms)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Ensure these accounts are properly categorized under appropriate account types (typically Current Assets for cash and bank accounts)</li>
    <li>Set opening balances if required</li>
    <li>Activate the accounts to make them available for transactions</li>
</ol>

<h3>Linking Accounts to Payment Transactions</h3>
<p>When recording payments, you can link them to specific payment accounts:</p>

    <li><strong>Payment Accounts:</strong> These accounts track the flow of money for payment transactions</li>
</ul>
