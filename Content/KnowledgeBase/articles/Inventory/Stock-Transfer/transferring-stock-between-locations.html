<h2>Transferring Stock Between Locations</h2>
<p>Stock Transfer in EquiBillBook allows you to move inventory items from one location or branch to another. This feature is essential for businesses with multiple warehouses, branches, or storage locations to maintain accurate inventory across all locations.</p>

<h3>What is Stock Transfer?</h3>
<p>Stock Transfer is the process of moving inventory items from a source location (where stock is currently stored) to a destination location (where stock needs to be moved). This helps you:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Balance inventory across multiple locations</li>
    <li>Move stock closer to customers or sales points</li>
    <li>Replenish stock at locations with low inventory</li>
    <li>Maintain accurate inventory records across all branches</li>
    <li>Track inter-branch movements for reporting and analysis</li>
</ul>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<p>Before you can transfer stock between locations:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Multiple Locations:</strong> You must have at least two locations/branches configured in your system</li>
    <li><strong>Stock Tracking Enabled:</strong> Stock tracking must be enabled for the items you want to transfer</li>
    <li><strong>Item Availability:</strong> The source location must have sufficient stock of the items to transfer</li>
    <li><strong>Location Access:</strong> You must have access permissions for both source and destination locations</li>
</ul>

<h3>Accessing Stock Transfer</h3>
<p>To create a new stock transfer:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Log in to your EquiBillBook account</li>
    <li>Navigate to <strong>Inventory</strong> → <strong>Stock Transfer</strong> → <strong>Create</strong></li>
    <li>You'll see the Stock Transfer creation form</li>
</ol>

<h3>Step-by-Step Stock Transfer Creation</h3>

<h4>Step 1: Select Source Location</h4>
<p>Choose the location from where stock will be transferred:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Select the <strong>Source Location/Branch</strong> from the dropdown</li>
    <li>This is where the stock currently exists</li>
    <li>Only locations with available stock will show items</li>
    <li>The system will display current stock levels for this location</li>
</ul>

<h4>Step 2: Select Destination Location</h4>
<p>Choose where the stock will be moved to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Select the <strong>Destination Location/Branch</strong> from the dropdown</li>
    <li>This is where the stock will be received</li>
    <li>Cannot be the same as the source location</li>
    <li>Destination location must be active and accessible</li>
</ul>

<h4>Step 3: Enter Transfer Details</h4>
<p>Fill in the transfer information:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Transfer Date:</strong> The date when the transfer is initiated (defaults to today's date)</li>
    <li><strong>Transfer Number:</strong> Automatically generated based on your numbering rules, or enter a custom number</li>
    <li><strong>Reference Number:</strong> (Optional) Internal reference or tracking number</li>
    <li><strong>Expected Delivery Date:</strong> When the stock is expected to reach the destination</li>
    <li><strong>Transfer Type:</strong> Select the type of transfer (Regular, Emergency, Return, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Step 4: Add Items to Transfer</h4>
<p>Add items that need to be transferred:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Click <strong>"Add Item"</strong> or start typing in the item field</li>
    <li>Select the item from the dropdown (only items with stock at source location are available)</li>
    <li>Enter the <strong>Transfer Quantity</strong> (cannot exceed available stock at source)</li>
    <li>The system will show:
        <ul>
            <li>Available stock at source location</li>
            <li>Current stock at destination location</li>
            <li>Stock after transfer (projected)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Repeat for all items to be transferred</li>
</ol>

<h4>Step 5: Add Transfer Notes</h4>
<p>You can add additional information:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Transfer Reason:</strong> Reason for the transfer (replenishment, customer order, etc.)</li>
    <li><strong>Notes:</strong> Internal notes about the transfer</li>
    <li><strong>Special Instructions:</strong> Handling instructions or special requirements</li>
</ul>

<h4>Step 6: Review and Save</h4>
<p>Before finalizing the transfer:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Review all items and quantities</li>
    <li>Verify source and destination locations</li>
    <li>Check stock availability</li>
    <li>Click <strong>"Save Transfer"</strong> or <strong>"Create Transfer"</strong></li>
    <li>The transfer will be created with status "Pending" or "Draft"</li>
</ol>

<h3>Transfer Status</h3>
<p>Stock transfers can have different statuses:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Draft:</strong> Transfer is being prepared, stock not yet affected</li>
    <li><strong>Pending:</strong> Transfer is created and awaiting approval or processing</li>
    <li><strong>In Transit:</strong> Stock is being moved between locations</li>
    <li><strong>Received:</strong> Stock has been received at destination location</li>
    <li><strong>Completed:</strong> Transfer is fully processed and stock updated</li>
    <li><strong>Cancelled:</strong> Transfer has been cancelled</li>
</ul>

<h3>Stock Impact</h3>
<p>When a stock transfer is processed:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Source Location:</strong> Stock is deducted from the source location immediately</li>
    <li><strong>Destination Location:</strong> Stock is added to the destination location upon receipt</li>
    <li><strong>Real-time Updates:</strong> Stock levels are updated in real-time</li>
    <li><strong>Stock History:</strong> All transfers are recorded in stock movement history</li>
    <li><strong>Item Branch Mapping:</strong> Item branch quantities are automatically updated</li>
</ul>

<h3>Multi-location Considerations</h3>
<p>For businesses with multiple locations:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Location-specific Stock:</strong> Each location maintains separate stock levels</li>
    <li><strong>Transfer Visibility:</strong> All transfers are visible across locations (based on permissions)</li>
    <li><strong>Centralized Management:</strong> Manage all transfers from a central location</li>
    <li><strong>Branch Reports:</strong> Generate location-wise stock and transfer reports</li>
</ul>

<h3>Stock Availability Validation</h3>
<p>The system validates stock availability:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Quantity Check:</strong> Ensures transfer quantity doesn't exceed available stock</li>
    <li><strong>Real-time Validation:</strong> Checks stock at the time of transfer creation</li>
    <li><strong>Reserved Stock:</strong> Considers reserved stock when calculating availability</li>
    <li><strong>Error Prevention:</strong> Prevents transfers that would result in negative stock</li>
</ul>

<h3>Best Practices</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Always verify stock availability before creating transfers</li>
    <li>Use appropriate transfer reasons for better tracking and reporting</li>
    <li>Set realistic expected delivery dates</li>
    <li>Review transfer history regularly to identify patterns</li>
    <li>Keep transfer notes for audit and reference purposes</li>
    <li>Process transfers promptly to maintain accurate inventory</li>
    <li>Coordinate with destination location before large transfers</li>
    <li>Use draft status to prepare transfers without affecting stock</li>
</ul>

<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
<p><strong>Cannot select items for transfer?</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Verify that stock tracking is enabled for the items</li>
    <li>Check that source location has available stock</li>
    <li>Ensure items are mapped to the source location</li>

</ul>
