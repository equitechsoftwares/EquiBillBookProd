</ol>

<h3>Stock Accounting Methods</h3>
<p>When enabling stock tracking, you need to select a stock accounting method:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>FIFO (First-In-First-Out):</strong> Assumes the oldest stock is sold first. Best for perishable goods or items with expiry dates.</li>
    <li><strong>LIFO (Last-In-First-Out):</strong> Assumes the newest stock is sold first. Used in some accounting scenarios.</li>
    <li><strong>Average Cost:</strong> Uses the average cost of all stock. Provides a balanced approach for most businesses.</li>
</ul>
<p>This method determines how stock costs are calculated when items are sold.</p>

<h3>Multi-Branch Stock Tracking</h3>
<p>If you have multiple branches or locations:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Stock tracking can be enabled per branch</li>
    <li>Each branch maintains its own stock levels</li>
    <li>Stock transfers between branches are tracked separately</li>
    <li>Reports can show stock by branch or consolidated view</li>
</ul>

<h3>What Happens When Stock Tracking is Enabled?</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Stock levels are automatically updated when you create sales invoices</li>
    <li>Stock increases when you record purchase bills</li>
    <li>Stock adjustments are tracked and recorded</li>
    <li>Stock transfers between locations are monitored</li>
    <li>Low stock alerts can be configured</li>
    <li>Stock reports become available</li>
</ul>

<h3>Important Considerations</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Service Items:</strong> Disable stock tracking for services or non-inventory items</li>
    <li><strong>Opening Stock:</strong> You'll need to enter opening stock balances for existing inventory</li>
    <li><strong>Stock Valuation:</strong> Ensure accurate cost prices are entered for proper valuation</li>
    <li><strong>Multi-location:</strong> Configure stock tracking for each branch/location separately</li>
    <li><strong>Permissions:</strong> Ensure users have appropriate permissions to view and manage stock</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>You can disable it at the item level for specific items</li>
    <li>Disabling at organization level affects all items</li>
    <li>Historical stock data is preserved but not updated</li>
