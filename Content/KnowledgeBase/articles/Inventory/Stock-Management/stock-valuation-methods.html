<h2>Stock Valuation Methods</h2>
<p>Stock valuation methods determine how the cost of inventory is calculated when items are sold. EquiBillBook supports multiple valuation methods to suit different business needs. This guide explains each method and how to choose the right one for your business.</p>

<h3>What is Stock Valuation?</h3>
<p>Stock valuation is the process of:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Assigning a cost value to inventory items</li>
    <li>Calculating the cost of goods sold (COGS)</li>
    <li>Determining inventory asset value on the balance sheet</li>
    <li>Impact on profit margins and financial reporting</li>
</ul>

<h3>Available Valuation Methods</h3>
<p>EquiBillBook supports three main stock valuation methods:</p>

<h3>1. FIFO (First-In-First-Out)</h3>
<p><strong>How it works:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Assumes the oldest stock is sold first</li>
    <li>Cost of oldest purchases is used for COGS</li>
    <li>Remaining stock is valued at newer purchase prices</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Perishable goods (food, medicines)</li>
    <li>Items with expiry dates</li>
    <li>Businesses where oldest stock should be sold first</li>
    <li>Compliance with certain accounting standards</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Matches physical flow of goods</li>
    <li>Prevents stock from becoming obsolete</li>
    <li>Generally accepted accounting method</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. LIFO (Last-In-First-Out)</h3>
<p><strong>How it works:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Assumes the newest stock is sold first</li>
    <li>Cost of newest purchases is used for COGS</li>
    <li>Remaining stock is valued at older purchase prices</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Non-perishable goods</li>
    <li>Items that don't expire</li>
    <li>Businesses where stock doesn't deteriorate</li>
    <li>Tax optimization in some scenarios</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>May reduce tax liability in inflationary periods</li>
    <li>Matches current market costs to revenue</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> LIFO may not be allowed in some countries for accounting purposes.</p>

<h3>3. Average Cost (Weighted Average)</h3>
<p><strong>How it works:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Calculates average cost of all stock</li>
    <li>Uses weighted average based on quantities purchased</li>
    <li>Same average cost used for all sales until new purchase</li>
    <li>Recalculates average when new stock is purchased</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Most businesses with standard inventory</li>
    <li>Items with similar characteristics</li>
    <li>Simplified cost tracking</li>
    <li>When exact lot tracking is not critical</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Simplifies cost calculations</li>
    <li>Smooths out price fluctuations</li>
    <li>Easy to understand and implement</li>
    <li>Reduces complexity in inventory management</li>
</ul>

<h3>Setting Stock Valuation Method</h3>
<p>To configure the valuation method:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Navigate to <strong>Settings</strong> → <strong>Item Settings</strong></li>
    <li>Find <strong>Stock Accounting Method</strong> or <strong>Stock Valuation Method</strong></li>
    <li>Select your preferred method (FIFO, LIFO, or Average Cost)</li>
    <li>Save the settings</li>
    <li>The method applies to all items with stock tracking enabled</li>
</ol>

<h3>Impact on Financial Reports</h3>
<p>Different methods affect:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):</strong> Different methods calculate different COGS</li>
    <li><strong>Gross Profit:</strong> Varies based on COGS calculation</li>
    <li><strong>Inventory Value:</strong> Balance sheet inventory value differs by method</li>
    <li><strong>Tax Liability:</strong> Can impact taxable income</li>
</ul>

<h3>Example Comparison</h3>
<p>Consider this scenario:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Purchase 100 units at ₹10 each (Total: ₹1,000)</li>
    <li>Purchase 100 units at ₹15 each (Total: ₹1,500)</li>
    <li>Sell 100 units</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>FIFO:</strong> COGS = ₹1,000 (oldest stock), Remaining = ₹1,500</p>
<p><strong>LIFO:</strong> COGS = ₹1,500 (newest stock), Remaining = ₹1,000</p>
<p><strong>Average:</strong> COGS = ₹1,250 (average of ₹12.50), Remaining = ₹1,250</p>

<h3>Changing Valuation Method</h3>
<p>Important considerations:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Changing methods mid-year may require accounting adjustments</li>
    <li>Consult with your accountant before changing methods</li>
    <li>Some methods may not be allowed in your country</li>
    <li>Changes may require restating previous periods</li>
    <li>Document the reason for method change</li>
</ul>

<h3>Multi-Branch Considerations</h3>
<p>When using multiple branches:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Valuation method applies consistently across all branches</li>
    <li>Stock transfers maintain cost basis</li>
    <li>Consolidated reports use the same method</li>
