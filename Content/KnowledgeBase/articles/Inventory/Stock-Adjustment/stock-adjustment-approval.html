<h2>Stock Adjustment Approval</h2>
<p>The stock adjustment approval workflow in EquiBillBook helps ensure proper authorization controls, prevents unauthorized inventory changes, and maintains accountability for stock adjustments. This guide explains how the approval process works.</p>

<h3>Why Approval is Important</h3>
<p>Stock adjustment approval serves several critical purposes:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Control:</strong> Prevents unauthorized inventory changes</li>

    <li><strong>Accountability:</strong> Ensures responsible parties review adjustments</li>
</ul>

<h3>When Approval is Required</h3>
<p>Approval requirements depend on your system configuration:</p>

<h3>Creating Adjustments Requiring Approval</h3>

    <li>The adjustment will be saved with "Pending Approval" status</li>
    <li>Approvers will receive notification</li>
    <li>Stock levels are NOT updated until approval is granted</li>
</ol>

<h3>Approval Status Types</h3>
