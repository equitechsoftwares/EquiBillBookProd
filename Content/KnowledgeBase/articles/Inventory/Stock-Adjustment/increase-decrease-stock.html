<h2>Increase/Decrease Stock</h2>
<p>Understanding when and how to increase or decrease stock levels in EquiBillBook is crucial for maintaining accurate inventory records. This guide covers all aspects of stock quantity adjustments.</p>

<h3>Understanding Stock Adjustments</h3>
<p>Stock adjustments allow you to modify inventory quantities directly, independent of sales or purchase transactions. This is useful for:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Correcting discrepancies between system and physical stock</li>
    <li>Recording stock found or discovered</li>
    <li>Writing off damaged, expired, or lost items</li>
    <li>Adjusting for production or manufacturing changes</li>
    <li>Recording stock received without purchase documentation</li>
</ul>

<h3>When to Increase Stock</h3>
<p>Increase stock levels when:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Physical Count Variance:</strong> Physical inventory shows more stock than the system</li>
    <li><strong>Found Stock:</strong> Previously missing or misplaced items are discovered</li>
    <li><strong>Free Stock Received:</strong> Items received without purchase bill (samples, gifts, etc.)</li>
    <li><strong>Production Output:</strong> Manufacturing or assembly creates new finished goods</li>
    <li><strong>Return from Customer:</strong> Items returned but not yet recorded in sales return</li>
    <li><strong>Data Correction:</strong> Previous adjustment was incorrectly recorded as decrease</li>
</ul>

<h3>When to Decrease Stock</h3>
<p>Decrease stock levels when:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Physical Count Variance:</strong> Physical inventory shows less stock than the system</li>
    <li><strong>Damage/Loss:</strong> Items are damaged, lost, or stolen</li>
    <li><strong>Expired Items:</strong> Products past expiration date need to be removed</li>
    <li><strong>Obsolete Stock:</strong> Items no longer usable or sellable</li>
    <li><strong>Sample/Free Issue:</strong> Items given away for samples or promotional purposes</li>
    <li><strong>Internal Consumption:</strong> Stock used internally (not through sales)</li>
    <li><strong>Data Correction:</strong> Previous entry was incorrect and needs correction</li>
</ul>

<h3>Methods of Adjusting Stock</h3>
<p>EquiBillBook offers different methods to adjust stock:</p>

<h4>1. Direct Quantity Entry</h4>
<p>Set the exact quantity you want the stock to be:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Enter the final quantity desired</li>
    <li>System calculates the difference automatically</li>
    <li>Best for setting stock to a known value</li>
</ul>

<h4>2. Adjustment Amount Entry</h4>
<p>Enter the amount to increase or decrease:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Positive number for increase (e.g., +10)</li>
    <li>Negative number for decrease (e.g., -5)</li>
    <li>System calculates new quantity automatically</li>
    <li>Best for recording specific adjustments</li>
</ul>

<h4>3. Percentage Adjustment</h4>
<p>Some systems allow percentage-based adjustments:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Useful for bulk adjustments</li>
    <li>Apply to multiple items simultaneously</li>

</ul>
