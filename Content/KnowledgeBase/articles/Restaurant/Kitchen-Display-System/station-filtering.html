<h2>Station Filtering</h2>
<p>Station Filtering in EquiBillBook's Kitchen Display System allows you to filter and display orders based on assigned kitchen stations. This helps organize orders and ensures kitchen staff only see the items relevant to their station, improving efficiency and reducing confusion.</p>

<h3>What is Station Filtering?</h3>
<p>Station Filtering is a feature that displays only the orders assigned to a specific kitchen station. When you select a station, the Kitchen Display System shows only the items that should be prepared at that particular station, helping kitchen staff focus on their specific tasks.</p>

<h3>How Station Filtering Works</h3>
<p>Station Filtering operates based on:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Station Assignment:</strong> Items in KOTs are assigned to specific kitchen stations</li>
    <li><strong>Category Mapping:</strong> Stations are linked to item categories</li>
    <li><strong>Filter Selection:</strong> You can select one or more stations to view</li>
    <li><strong>Dynamic Updates:</strong> Filtered view updates automatically as new orders come in</li>
</ul>

<h3>Accessing Station Filtering</h3>
<p>To use Station Filtering:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Navigate to <strong>Restaurant</strong> → <strong>Kitchen Display</strong></li>
    <li>Look for the station filter dropdown or station selection buttons</li>
    <li>Select the station(s) you want to view</li>
    <li>The display will update to show only orders for selected stations</li>
</ol>

<h3>Filtering Options</h3>
<p>Station Filtering offers various options:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Single Station View:</strong> View orders for one specific station</li>
    <li><strong>Multiple Station View:</strong> Select multiple stations to view simultaneously</li>
    <li><strong>All Stations:</strong> View orders for all stations (default view)</li>
    <li><strong>Station Groups:</strong> Group related stations together for viewing</li>
</ul>

<h3>Setting Up Station Filtering</h3>
<p>Before using Station Filtering, ensure:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Stations are Created:</strong> All kitchen stations are set up in the system</li>
    <li><strong>Categories are Assigned:</strong> Stations are linked to appropriate item categories</li>
    <li><strong>KOTs Assign Stations:</strong> KOTs properly assign items to stations based on categories</li>
    <li><strong>Stations are Active:</strong> Stations are set to active status</li>
</ol>

<h3>Using Station Filters</h3>
<p>To filter orders by station:</p>
<ol>
    <li>On the Kitchen Display page, locate the station filter control</li>

    <li>The display will refresh to show only orders for selected stations</li>
    <li>Orders are organized by the selected station(s)</li>
</ol>

<h3>Benefits of Station Filtering</h3>
<p>Station Filtering provides several advantages:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Reduced Clutter:</strong> Staff only see relevant orders for their station</li>
    <li><strong>Improved Focus:</strong> Better concentration on station-specific tasks</li>

</ul>

<h3>Multi-Station Display</h3>
<p>When multiple stations are selected:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Orders are grouped by station within the display</li>
    <li>Each station section is clearly labeled</li>
    <li>Orders within each station are organized chronologically or by status</li>
    <li>Staff can easily identify which station should handle each order</li>
</ul>

<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>

    <li><strong>Filter Not Applying:</strong> Refresh the page or clear browser cache</li>
    <li><strong>Items in Wrong Station:</strong> Review item category assignments in station configuration</li>
</ul>

<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<p>After configuring Station Filtering:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Enable Real-time Order Display for automatic updates</li>
    <li>Set up Order Timers to track preparation time</li>
    <li>Configure Status Updates for order progress tracking</li>
</ul>
