<h2>Booking Status Workflow</h2>
<p>Understanding the booking status workflow in EquiBillBook is essential for effective reservation management. This guide explains all booking statuses and how they transition throughout the booking lifecycle.</p>

<h3>What is Booking Status Workflow?</h3>
<p>The booking status workflow tracks the progress of table reservations from creation to completion. Each status represents a stage in the booking lifecycle and helps you manage reservations effectively.</p>

<h3>Booking Statuses</h3>
<p>EquiBillBook includes the following booking statuses:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Pending:</strong> Initial status when a booking is created but not yet confirmed</li>
    <li><strong>Confirmed:</strong> Booking has been confirmed and is expected to proceed</li>
    <li><strong>Seated:</strong> Customers have arrived and are seated at their tables</li>
    <li><strong>Completed:</strong> The booking has been completed and customers have left</li>
    <li><strong>Cancelled:</strong> The booking has been cancelled</li>
    <li><strong>No-Show:</strong> Customers did not arrive for their reservation</li>
</ul>

<h3>Status Transitions</h3>
<p>Understanding how statuses transition:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Pending → Confirmed:</strong> When you confirm the booking with the customer</li>
    <li><strong>Confirmed → Seated:</strong> When customers arrive and are seated</li>
    <li><strong>Seated → Completed:</strong> When customers finish their meal and leave</li>
    <li><strong>Any Status → Cancelled:</strong> When a booking is cancelled at any stage</li>
    <li><strong>Confirmed/Pending → No-Show:</strong> When customers don't arrive for their booking</li>
</ul>

<h3>Changing Booking Status</h3>
