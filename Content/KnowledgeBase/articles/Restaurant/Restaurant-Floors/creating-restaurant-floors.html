<h2>Creating Restaurant Floors</h2>
<p>Restaurant floors help you organize your restaurant space into manageable sections. This guide will walk you through creating floors in EquiBillBook, which is essential for managing tables and bookings effectively.</p>

<h3>What are Restaurant Floors?</h3>
<p>Restaurant floors are organizational units that help you:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Group tables by physical location (Ground Floor, First Floor, Outdoor, etc.)</li>
    <li>Manage bookings across different areas of your restaurant</li>
    <li>Organize tables for better visibility and management</li>
    <li>Generate floor-wise reports and analytics</li>
    <li>Assign staff to specific floors</li>
</ul>

<h3>Accessing Floor Management</h3>
<p>To create restaurant floors:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Navigate to <strong>Restaurant</strong> from the main menu</li>
    <li>Click on <strong>Floors</strong> or <strong>Restaurant Floors</strong></li>
    <li>You'll see the list of existing floors (if any)</li>
    <li>Click <strong>Create New Floor</strong> or <strong>Add Floor</strong> button</li>
</ol>

<h3>Creating a New Floor</h3>
<p>Follow these steps to create a floor:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Click the <strong>Create New Floor</strong> button</li>
    <li>Enter the <strong>Floor Name</strong> (e.g., "Ground Floor", "First Floor", "Outdoor Seating", "VIP Section")</li>
    <li>Enter a <strong>Floor Code</strong> (optional, for quick reference, e.g., "GF", "FF", "OUT")</li>
    <li>Add a <strong>Description</strong> (optional, to describe the floor's characteristics)</li>
    <li>Set the <strong>Capacity</strong> (optional, total number of seats or tables the floor can accommodate)</li>
    <li>Set the <strong>Status</strong>:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Active:</strong> Floor is available for use</li>
            <li><strong>Inactive:</strong> Floor is temporarily disabled</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Click <strong>Save</strong> or <strong>Create Floor</strong></li>
</ol>

<h3>Floor Details</h3>
<p>When creating a floor, consider these details:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Floor Name:</strong> Use clear, descriptive names (e.g., "Ground Floor - Main Dining", "First Floor - Private Rooms")</li>
    <li><strong>Floor Code:</strong> Short codes help with quick identification and reporting</li>
    <li><strong>Description:</strong> Add notes about floor features, ambiance, or special characteristics</li>
    <li><strong>Capacity:</strong> Helps with planning and ensures you don't overbook</li>
</ul>

<h3>Floor Status</h3>
<p>Understanding floor status:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Active:</strong> Floor is operational and can accept bookings</li>
    <li><strong>Inactive:</strong> Floor is temporarily unavailable (e.g., under renovation, closed for maintenance)</li>
    <li>Inactive floors won't appear in booking options but existing data is preserved</li>
</ul>

<h3>Best Practices for Floor Naming</h3>
<p>Use consistent naming conventions:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Use clear, descriptive names that staff and customers can understand</li>
    <li>Consider using numbers or codes for multi-floor restaurants (Floor 1, Floor 2, etc.)</li>
    <li>For single-floor restaurants, you might use area names (Main Dining, Bar Area, Outdoor)</li>
    <li>Avoid special characters that might cause issues in reports or exports</li>
</ul>

<h3>Common Floor Examples</h3>
<p>Examples of floor setups:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Single Floor Restaurant:</strong> "Main Dining Area"</li>
    <li><strong>Multi-Floor Restaurant:</strong> "Ground Floor", "First Floor", "Second Floor"</li>
    <li><strong>Restaurant with Sections:</strong> "Indoor Dining", "Outdoor Seating", "Private Rooms"</li>
    <li><strong>Large Restaurant:</strong> "Main Hall", "VIP Section", "Bar Area", "Outdoor Patio"</li>
</ul>

<h3>Editing Floors</h3>

    <li>Go to <strong>Restaurant</strong> → <strong>Floors</strong></li>
    <li>Find the floor you want to edit</li>
    <li>Click on the floor name or the <strong>Edit</strong> button</li>
    <li>Modify the details as needed</li>
    <li>Click <strong>Save</strong> to apply changes</li>
</ol>

<h3>Deleting Floors</h3>

    <li>Click <strong>Delete</strong> or the delete icon</li>
    <li>Confirm the deletion</li>
    <li><strong>Note:</strong> You can only delete floors that have no tables assigned. Move or delete tables first if needed.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Viewing Floor Information</h3>
