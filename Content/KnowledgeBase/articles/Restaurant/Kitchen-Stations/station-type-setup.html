<h2>Station Type Setup</h2>
<p>Station Types in EquiBillBook help categorize and organize your kitchen stations based on their function or location. This guide will walk you through setting up station types to better manage your kitchen operations.</p>

<h3>What are Station Types?</h3>
<p>Station Types are classifications that group kitchen stations by their purpose, location, or function. Examples include "Main Kitchen", "Cold Station", "Hot Station", "Beverage Station", "Grill Station", "Salad Station", etc. Using station types helps organize your kitchen layout and makes it easier to manage multiple stations.</p>

<h3>Accessing Station Types</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Navigate to <strong>Settings</strong> from the main menu</li>
    <li>Go to <strong>Restaurant Settings</strong> → <strong>Station Types</strong></li>
    <li>Click the <strong>"Add Station Type"</strong> or <strong>"Create New"</strong> button</li>
</ol>
