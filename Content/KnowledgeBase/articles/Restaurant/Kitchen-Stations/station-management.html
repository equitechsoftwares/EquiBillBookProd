<h2>Station Management</h2>
<p>Station Management in EquiBillBook allows you to view, edit, activate, deactivate, and organize your kitchen stations efficiently. This guide covers all aspects of managing your kitchen stations to maintain an organized and efficient kitchen operation.</p>

<h3>Accessing Station Management</h3>
<p>To manage kitchen stations:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Navigate to <strong>Settings</strong> from the main menu</li>
    <li>Click on <strong>Kitchen Stations</strong></li>
    <li>You'll see a list of all kitchen stations with their details</li>
</ol>

<h3>Viewing Stations</h3>
<p>The station list displays:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Station Name:</strong> The name of the kitchen station</li>
    <li><strong>Station Type:</strong> The type/category of the station</li>
    <li><strong>Categories:</strong> Item categories assigned to the station</li>
    <li><strong>Printer:</strong> Assigned printer (if any)</li>
    <li><strong>Status:</strong> Active or Inactive status</li>
    <li><strong>Branch:</strong> Branch location (for multi-branch setups)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Editing Stations</h3>
<p>To edit an existing station:</p>
<ol>
    <li>From the station list, click on the station you want to edit</li>
    <li>Or click the <strong>"Edit"</strong> button/icon for that station</li>
    <li>Modify the station details (name, type, categories, printer, status)</li>
    <li>Click <strong>"Save"</strong> to update the station</li>
</ol>

<h3>Activating and Deactivating Stations</h3>
<p>You can activate or deactivate stations without deleting them:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Active Stations:</strong> Receive new KOT orders and appear in kitchen displays</li>
    <li><strong>Inactive Stations:</strong> Don't receive new orders but historical data is preserved</li>
    <li>Use this feature for seasonal stations or when temporarily closing a station</li>
    <li>Deactivate stations that are under maintenance or not in use</li>
</ol>

<h3>Deleting Stations</h3>
<p>To delete a station:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Stations can typically only be deleted if they have no associated KOTs or orders</li>
    <li>Deleting a station removes it permanently from the system</li>
    <li>Consider deactivating instead of deleting to preserve historical data</li>
    <li>Ensure no active KOTs are assigned to the station before deletion</li>
</ol>

<h3>Filtering and Searching Stations</h3>
<p>Use filters to find stations quickly:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Search by Name:</strong> Use the search box to find stations by name</li>
    <li><strong>Filter by Station Type:</strong> View stations grouped by type</li>
    <li><strong>Filter by Status:</strong> Show only active or inactive stations</li>
    <li><strong>Filter by Branch:</strong> View stations for a specific branch (multi-branch setups)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bulk Operations</h3>
<p>Some bulk operations may be available:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Activate or deactivate multiple stations at once</li>
    <li>Export station list for reporting or backup</li>
    <li>Import stations from Excel/CSV (if supported)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Station Reports</h3>
<p>Generate reports to analyze station performance:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Station-wise KOT Reports:</strong> View orders handled by each station</li>
    <li><strong>Station Performance Reports:</strong> Analyze efficiency and workload</li>
    <li><strong>Category Assignment Reports:</strong> Review which categories are assigned to which stations</li>
    <li><strong>Station Activity Reports:</strong> Track station usage over time</li>
</ul>

<h3>Multi-Branch Station Management</h3>
<p>For multi-branch setups:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Each branch can have its own set of kitchen stations</li>
    <li>Filter stations by branch to manage branch-specific operations</li>
    <li>Stations can be copied or replicated across branches</li>
    <li>Maintain consistent station naming across branches for easier management</li>
</ul>

<h3>Printer Management</h3>
<p>Managing printers for stations:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Assign or change printers for each station</li>
    <li>Ensure printers are properly configured before assignment</li>
    <li>Test printer assignments to verify KOT printing works correctly</li>
    <li>Update printer assignments when hardware changes</li>
</ol>

<h3>Best Practices</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Review station list regularly to ensure it matches your kitchen layout</li>
    <li>Keep station names consistent and descriptive</li>
    <li>Deactivate unused stations instead of deleting them</li>
    <li>Document station assignments and configurations</li>
    <li>Regularly review category assignments to ensure they're current</li>
    <li>Test station configurations after making changes</li>
    <li>Keep a backup or export of station configurations</li>
    <li>Train staff on station management procedures</li>
</ul>

<h3>Troubleshooting Common Issues</h3>
<p>Common issues and solutions:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Stations not receiving orders:</strong> Check if station is active and categories are assigned</li>
    <li><strong>Items routing to wrong station:</strong> Review category assignments</li>
    <li><strong>Printer not working:</strong> Verify printer assignment and configuration</li>
    <li><strong>Station not appearing in list:</strong> Check filters and branch selection</li>
    <li><strong>Cannot delete station:</strong> Ensure no active KOTs are assigned</li>
</ul>

<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<p>After managing your stations, you can:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Create KOTs and verify station routing</li>
    <li>Set up kitchen display systems</li>
    <li>Generate station performance reports</li>
    <li>Optimize station assignments based on workflow</li>
    <li>Train kitchen staff on station operations</li>
</ul>
