<h2>Station Assignment</h2>
<p>Station Assignment in EquiBillBook determines which kitchen station handles which food items when KOTs (Kitchen Order Tickets) are created. This guide explains how to assign item categories to stations for efficient order routing and kitchen workflow.</p>

<h3>What is Station Assignment?</h3>
<p>Station Assignment is the process of linking item categories to specific kitchen stations. When a KOT is created with items from different categories, each item is automatically routed to the appropriate station based on its category assignment. This ensures orders are prepared at the correct location in your kitchen.</p>

<h3>How Station Assignment Works</h3>
<p>The assignment process works as follows:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Items in EquiBillBook are organized into categories (e.g., Appetizers, Main Course, Desserts, Beverages)</li>
    <li>Each kitchen station can be assigned one or more categories</li>
    <li>When a KOT is created, items are automatically routed to stations based on their category</li>
    <li>If an item's category is assigned to multiple stations, the item may appear at all assigned stations</li>
</ol>

<h3>Assigning Categories to Stations</h3>
<p>To assign categories to a kitchen station:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Navigate to <strong>Settings</strong> → <strong>Kitchen Stations</strong></li>
    <li>Create a new station or edit an existing one</li>
    <li>In the <strong>Categories</strong> field, select one or more categories that this station will handle</li>
    <li>You can select multiple categories by holding Ctrl (Windows) or Cmd (Mac) while clicking</li>
    <li>Save the station to apply the category assignments</li>
</ol>

<h3>Category Assignment Examples</h3>
<p>Here are some common assignment scenarios:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Main Kitchen Station:</strong> Assign "Main Course", "Rice", "Curries", "Breads"</li>
    <li><strong>Salad Station:</strong> Assign "Salads", "Cold Appetizers", "Soups"</li>
    <li><strong>Dessert Station:</strong> Assign "Desserts", "Ice Cream", "Sweets"</li>
    <li><strong>Beverage Station:</strong> Assign "Beverages", "Juices", "Soft Drinks", "Coffee"</li>
    <li><strong>Grill Station:</strong> Assign "Grilled Items", "BBQ", "Tandoor"</li>
</ul>

<h3>Multiple Station Assignment</h3>
<p>You can assign the same category to multiple stations if needed:</p>
<ul>
    <li>This is useful when multiple stations can prepare the same type of items</li>
    <li>Items from that category will appear at all assigned stations</li>
    <li>Use this when you have backup stations or when items can be prepared at different locations</li>
    <li>Example: Assign "Beverages" to both "Bar Station" and "Beverage Station"</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ensuring Complete Coverage</h3>
<p>Important considerations:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Ensure every item category used in your menu is assigned to at least one active station</li>
    <li>If a category is not assigned to any station, items from that category may not appear in KOTs</li>
    <li>Review category assignments periodically to ensure they match your current menu</li>
    <li>Update assignments when you add new categories or change your kitchen layout</li>
</ol>

<h3>Viewing Station Assignments</h3>
<p>To view which categories are assigned to each station:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Go to <strong>Kitchen Stations</strong> list</li>
    <li>Click on a station to view or edit it</li>
    <li>The assigned categories will be displayed in the Categories field</li>
    <li>You can also view station assignments in station reports</li>
</ol>

<h3>Best Practices</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Assign categories logically based on your kitchen's physical layout</li>
    <li>Ensure all menu item categories are assigned to at least one station</li>
    <li>Review assignments when you add new menu items or categories</li>
    <li>Keep assignments simple - avoid over-complicating the routing</li>
    <li>Test assignments by creating sample KOTs to ensure items route correctly</li>
    <li>Document your assignment strategy for team reference</li>
    <li>Update assignments when kitchen layout or menu changes</li>
</ul>

<h3>Troubleshooting Assignment Issues</h3>
<p>If items are not appearing at the expected stations:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Verify that the item's category is assigned to the station</li>
    <li>Check that the station is active</li>
    <li>Ensure the category is active and assigned to items</li>
    <li>Review KOT creation to confirm items are being added correctly</li>
    <li>Check if multiple stations are assigned and items are routing to all of them</li>
</ol>

<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<p>After setting up station assignments, you can:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Create KOTs and verify items route to correct stations</li>
    <li>Use kitchen display systems to view orders by station</li>
    <li>Generate station-wise reports to analyze performance</li>
    <li>Optimize assignments based on kitchen workflow and efficiency</li>
</ul>
