<h2>Creating Sales Returns</h2>
<p>Sales Returns in EquiBillBook allow you to process customer returns, issue credit notes, and restore stock to inventory. This guide will walk you through the process of creating a sales return step by step.</p>

<h3>Accessing Sales Returns</h3>
<p>To create a new sales return:</p>

    <li>Navigate to the <strong>Sales</strong> module from the main menu</li>
    <li>Click on <strong>Sales Return</strong> or <strong>Returns</strong></li>
    <li>Click the <strong>"Create New"</strong> or <strong>"Add Return"</strong> button</li>
</ol>

<h3>Selecting the Original Invoice</h3>
<p>The first step in creating a sales return is to select the original sales invoice:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Search for Invoice:</strong> Enter the invoice number or select from the list</li>
    <li><strong>Invoice Details:</strong> The system will display the original invoice details including customer, date, and items</li>
    <li><strong>Return Date:</strong> Select the date when the return is being processed (defaults to today's date)</li>
    <li><strong>Branch:</strong> Select the branch/location (if using multi-branch setup)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Selecting Items for Return</h3>

<ol>
    <li>The system displays all items from the original invoice</li>
    <li>Select the items that are being returned</li>
    <li>Enter the <strong>return quantity</strong> for each item (cannot exceed the original quantity)</li>
    <li>Review the unit price (usually matches the original invoice price)</li>
    <li>Add any <strong>return reason</strong> for each item if required</li>
</ol>

<h3>Return Details</h3>
<p>Configure the return details:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Return Reason:</strong> Select or enter the reason for the return (e.g., Defective, Wrong Item, Customer Request)</li>
    <li><strong>Notes:</strong> Add any additional notes about the return</li>
    <li><strong>Attach Document:</strong> Upload supporting documents if needed (e.g., return authorization, photos)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Calculations and Adjustments</h3>
<p>The system automatically calculates:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Subtotal:</strong> Total of returned items before discounts and taxes</li>
    <li><strong>Discount:</strong> Any applicable discounts (if the original invoice had discounts, they are typically adjusted proportionally)</li>
    <li><strong>Tax:</strong> Tax amounts are calculated based on the return quantities</li>
    <li><strong>Grand Total:</strong> Total credit amount to be issued to the customer</li>
</ul>

<h3>Stock Restoration</h3>
<p>When you create a sales return:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If stock tracking is enabled, the returned quantities are automatically added back to inventory</li>
    <li>Stock is restored to the location/branch from which the sale was made</li>
    <li>The stock movement is recorded in the stock history</li>
    <li>This helps maintain accurate inventory levels</li>
</ul>

<h3>Credit Note Generation</h3>
<p>A credit note is automatically generated when you create a sales return:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Credit Note Number:</strong> The system generates a unique credit note number</li>
    <li><strong>Linked to Invoice:</strong> The credit note is linked to the original sales invoice</li>
    <li><strong>Customer Credit:</strong> The customer's account is credited with the return amount</li>
    <li><strong>Print/Email:</strong> You can print or email the credit note to the customer</li>
</ul>

<h3>Saving the Sales Return</h3>
<p>Once all information is entered:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Review the return summary and totals</li>
    <li>Verify the items and quantities being returned</li>
    <li>Check the credit note amount</li>
    <li>Click <strong>"Save"</strong> or <strong>"Create Return"</strong> to finalize</li>
</ol>

<h3>Return Status</h3>
<p>Sales returns can have different statuses:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Draft:</strong> Return is being prepared but not finalized</li>
