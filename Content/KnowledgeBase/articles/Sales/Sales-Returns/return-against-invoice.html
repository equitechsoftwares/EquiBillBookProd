<h3>Finding the Original Invoice</h3>
<p>To process a return against an invoice:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Navigate to <strong>Sales</strong> → <strong>Sales Return</strong> → <strong>Create</strong></li>
    <li>Use the invoice search field to find the original invoice:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Enter the invoice number directly</li>
        <li>Search by customer name and date range</li>
        <li>Filter by invoice status if needed</li>
        <li>Browse recent invoices from the customer</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Select the invoice from the search results</li>
</ol>

<h3>Invoice Details Display</h3>
<p>Once you select an invoice, the system displays:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Invoice Information:</strong> Invoice number, date, customer details</li>
    <li><strong>Original Items:</strong> All items from the original invoice with quantities and prices</li>
    <li><strong>Original Totals:</strong> Subtotal, tax, discount, and grand total from the original invoice</li>
    <li><strong>Previous Returns:</strong> Information about any existing returns against this invoice</li>
    <li><strong>Available Quantities:</strong> Shows how much of each item can still be returned</li>
</ul>

<h3>Selecting Items to Return</h3>
<p>When processing a return against an invoice:</p>
<ol>
    <li>The system shows all items from the original invoice</li>
    <li>Select the items that the customer wants to return</li>
    <li>Enter the return quantity for each item</li>
    <li>The system validates that return quantities don't exceed:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Original quantities sold</li>
        <li>Already returned quantities (if partial returns were made previously)</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Unit prices are typically locked to match the original invoice prices</li>
</ol>

<h3>Partial Returns Against Invoice</h3>
<p>You can process multiple partial returns against the same invoice:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>First Return:</strong> Return some items or partial quantities</li>
    <li><strong>Subsequent Returns:</strong> Create additional returns for remaining items</li>
    <li><strong>System Tracking:</strong> The system tracks total returned amounts per invoice</li>
    <li><strong>Validation:</strong> Ensures you cannot return more than was originally sold</li>
    <li><strong>Credit Note:</strong> Each return generates its own credit note, all linked to the original invoice</li>
</ul>

<h3>Automatic Credit Note Linking</h3>
<p>When you create a return against an invoice:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A credit note is automatically generated</li>
    <li>The credit note references the original invoice number</li>
    <li>Customer account is credited with the return amount</li>
    <li>The credit can be applied against:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>The original invoice balance (if unpaid)</li>
        <li>Other outstanding invoices</li>
        <li>Future purchases</li>
        <li>Refund processing</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Stock Restoration</h3>
<p>When returning against an invoice:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Stock is restored to the same location/branch as the original sale</li>
    <li>If batch/lot tracking is enabled, stock is restored to the correct batch</li>
    <li>If expiry tracking is enabled, the original expiry dates are maintained</li>
    <li>Stock movement history records the return linked to the original sale</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tax Handling</h3>
<p>Tax calculations for returns:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Tax is typically reversed in proportion to the returned quantities</li>
    <li>Tax rates match the original invoice tax rates</li>
    <li>GST/VAT reversal follows applicable tax regulations</li>
    <li>Tax credit is properly accounted for in tax reports</li>
</ul>

<h3>Invoice Status Impact</h3>
<p>Returns affect the original invoice status:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Paid Invoices:</strong> Returns create credit that can be refunded or applied to other invoices</li>
    <li><strong>Unpaid Invoices:</strong> Returns reduce the outstanding balance</li>
    <li><strong>Partially Paid:</strong> Returns adjust the remaining balance</li>
    <li><strong>Fully Returned:</strong> If all items are returned, the invoice may show as fully credited</li>
</ul>

<h3>Return Validation Rules</h3>
<p>The system enforces several validation rules:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Cannot return more quantity than was originally sold</li>
    <li>Cannot return items that weren't in the original invoice</li>
    <li>Cannot process returns if the invoice is cancelled (may need to reverse cancellation first)</li>
    <li>Return dates should typically be after the invoice date</li>
    <li>May have time limits on returns depending on your settings</li>
</ul>

<h3>Best Practices</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Always verify the invoice number matches what the customer is returning</li>
    <li>Check the original invoice details before processing the return</li>
    <li>Review previous returns against the same invoice to avoid over-returning</li>
    <li>Verify customer identity for high-value returns</li>
    <li>Keep documentation (invoice copy, return authorization) for audit purposes</li>
    <li>Process returns promptly to maintain customer satisfaction</li>
    <li>Review return policies and time limits before processing</li>
</ul>

<h3>Viewing Return History</h3>
<p>To view all returns against a specific invoice:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Open the original sales invoice</li>
    <li>Look for a "Returns" or "Credit Notes" section</li>
    <li>View all linked returns and credit notes</li>
    <li>See the total returned amount and remaining balance</li>
</ul>

<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
<p><strong>Cannot find the invoice?</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Verify the invoice number is correct</li>
    <li>Check if the invoice belongs to a different branch (if using multi-branch)</li>

    <li>Try searching by customer name and date range</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cannot return the full quantity?</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Check if partial returns were already processed</li>
    <li>Review the "Available to Return" quantity for each item</li>
    <li>Verify the original invoice quantities</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Credit note doesn't match expected amount?</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Verify quantities and prices match the original invoice</li>
    <li>Check if discounts or charges are being adjusted correctly</li>
    <li>Review tax calculations and ensure they match the original invoice tax structure</li>

<p>Returning against invoices ensures accurate accounting, proper stock management, and maintains a complete audit trail of all transactions. This approach is essential for businesses that need to track returns accurately and maintain compliance with accounting standards.</p>
