<h2>Stock Restoration on Returns</h2>
<p>When customers return items, the stock needs to be restored to your inventory to maintain accurate stock levels. EquiBillBook automatically handles stock restoration when you process sales returns. This guide explains how stock restoration works.</p>

<h3>Automatic Stock Restoration</h3>
<p>When you create a sales return in EquiBillBook:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Stock is automatically added back to inventory (if stock tracking is enabled)</li>
    <li>The restoration happens immediately when the return is saved</li>
    <li>No manual stock adjustment is required</li>
    <li>Stock movement is recorded in inventory history</li>
</ul>

<h3>Prerequisites for Stock Restoration</h3>
<p>For stock restoration to work:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Stock Tracking Enabled:</strong> Stock tracking must be enabled for the items</li>
    <li><strong>Item Settings:</strong> Items must be configured for stock tracking</li>
    <li><strong>Inventory Module:</strong> Inventory module should be active in your account</li>
    <li><strong>Permissions:</strong> You need appropriate permissions for inventory operations</li>
</ul>

<h3>How Stock Restoration Works</h3>
<p>The restoration process:</p>
<ol>
    <li>When you create a sales return and select items to return</li>
    <li>The system identifies the original sale and location</li>
    <li>Stock quantities are added back to the same location/branch</li>
    <li>Stock levels are updated immediately</li>
    <li>Stock movement record is created showing the return</li>
</ol>

<h3>Location/Branch Restoration</h3>
<p>Stock is restored to the correct location:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Same Branch:</strong> Stock returns to the branch from which it was originally sold</li>
    <li><strong>Multi-location:</strong> In multi-branch setups, stock goes back to the selling branch</li>
    <li><strong>Location Accuracy:</strong> Ensures inventory accuracy across all locations</li>
    <li><strong>Transfer Handling:</strong> If items were transferred, restoration follows the original flow</li>
</ul>

<h3>Batch and Lot Tracking</h3>
<p>If your items use batch or lot tracking:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Batch Restoration:</strong> Stock is restored to the same batch/lot from which it was sold</li>
    <li><strong>Batch Identification:</strong> System maintains the link to the original batch</li>
    <li><strong>Expiry Dates:</strong> Original expiry dates are preserved if expiry tracking is enabled</li>
    <li><strong>Serial Numbers:</strong> Serial numbers are restored if serial number tracking is used</li>
</ul>

<h3>Partial Return Stock Restoration</h3>
<p>For partial returns:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Only the returned quantities are added back to stock</li>
    <li>Remaining sold quantities remain deducted from inventory</li>
    <li>Each partial return restores its respective quantities</li>
    <li>Multiple partial returns can restore stock incrementally</li>
</ul>

<h3>Stock Movement Records</h3>
<p>Every stock restoration creates a movement record:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Transaction Type:</strong> Recorded as "Sales Return" or "Return"</li>
    <li><strong>Reference:</strong> Linked to the sales return and original invoice</li>
    <li><strong>Quantity:</strong> Shows the quantity restored</li>
    <li><strong>Date/Time:</strong> Timestamp of the restoration</li>
    <li><strong>User:</strong> Person who processed the return</li>
    <li><strong>Audit Trail:</strong> Complete history for inventory tracking</li>
</ul>

<h3>Stock Valuation</h3>
<p>Stock valuation on returns:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Cost Method:</strong> Uses your configured stock valuation method (FIFO, LIFO, Average, etc.)</li>
    <li><strong>Return Cost:</strong> Typically uses the original cost from the sale</li>
    <li><strong>Valuation Update:</strong> Stock value is updated based on the valuation method</li>
    <li><strong>Accounting Impact:</strong> Affects cost of goods sold and inventory valuation</li>
</ul>

<h3>Viewing Restored Stock</h3>
<p>To verify stock restoration:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Current Stock:</strong> Check current stock levels for the items</li>
    <li><strong>Stock Movement:</strong> View stock movement history to see the restoration entry</li>
    <li><strong>Item Details:</strong> Check item details to see updated quantities</li>
    <li><strong>Location Stock:</strong> Verify stock at the specific branch/location</li>
</ul>

<h3>Quality Control Considerations</h3>
<p>When restoring stock from returns:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Product Condition:</strong> Physically inspect returned items before restoring to saleable stock</li>
    <li><strong>Damage Assessment:</strong> Damaged items may need separate handling (damaged stock category)</li>
    <li><strong>Expiry Check:</strong> Verify expiry dates if applicable</li>
    <li><strong>Testing:</strong> Test returned items if they are electronic or mechanical</li>
    <li><strong>Segregation:</strong> Consider segregating returned items initially</li>
</ul>

<h3>Disabling Stock Restoration</h3>
<p>In some cases, you might not want to restore stock:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Damaged Goods:</strong> If items are damaged beyond repair</li>
    <li><strong>Expired Items:</strong> If items have expired and cannot be resold</li>
    <li><strong>Warranty Returns:</strong> Items returned under warranty to manufacturer</li>
    <li><strong>Manual Control:</strong> Some systems allow manual control over stock restoration</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Check your system settings to see if you can control stock restoration behavior.</p>

<h3>Stock Restoration Reports</h3>
<p>Track stock restoration through reports:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Stock Movement Report:</strong> Shows all stock movements including returns</li>
    <li><strong>Sales Return Report:</strong> Includes stock restoration information</li>
    <li><strong>Inventory Adjustment Report:</strong> Shows stock changes from returns</li>
    <li><strong>Item-wise Return Report:</strong> Track returns and restoration by item</li>
</ul>

<h3>Best Practices</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Always verify that stock tracking is enabled for items before processing returns</li>
    <li>Review stock levels after processing returns to confirm restoration</li>
    <li>Physically inspect returned items before considering them as saleable stock</li>
    <li>Maintain separate categories for damaged or non-saleable returned items if needed</li>
    <li>Review stock movement reports regularly to track return patterns</li>
    <li>Ensure proper documentation of returns for inventory audits</li>
    <li>Train staff on return processing to maintain inventory accuracy</li>
</ul>
