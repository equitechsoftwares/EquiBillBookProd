<h2>Proforma vs Invoice</h2>
<p>Understanding the difference between proforma invoices and regular invoices is crucial for proper business documentation and compliance. While they may look similar, they serve different purposes and have distinct legal and accounting implications.</p>

<h3>What is a Proforma Invoice?</h3>
<p>A proforma invoice is a preliminary bill or estimated invoice sent to a buyer before goods or services are shipped or delivered. It provides an estimate of the final invoice and includes details about the items, quantities, prices, and terms of sale.</p>

<h3>What is a Regular Invoice?</h3>
<p>A regular invoice (also called a tax invoice or commercial invoice) is a legally binding document that requests payment for goods or services that have been delivered or completed. It serves as an official record of the transaction and is required for accounting and tax purposes.</p>

<h3>Important Considerations</h3>

<h4>Tax Implications</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Proforma Invoice:</strong> No tax liability is created. It's just an estimate.</li>
    <li><strong>Regular Invoice:</strong> Creates tax liability. GST/VAT must be paid to the government.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Accounting Implications</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Proforma Invoice:</strong> Not recorded in books. No impact on financial statements.</li>
    <li><strong>Regular Invoice:</strong> Recorded as sales revenue and accounts receivable. Affects P&L and balance sheet.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Legal Implications</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Proforma Invoice:</strong> Not legally binding. Customer is not obligated to pay.</li>
    <li><strong>Regular Invoice:</strong> Legally binding. Customer must pay as per terms.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Best Practices</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Always clearly label documents as "Proforma Invoice" or "Invoice"</li>
    <li>Use proforma invoices for estimates and advance payments</li>
    <li>Convert proforma to invoice only when goods/services are delivered</li>
    <li>Ensure regular invoices comply with tax and legal requirements</li>
    <li>Keep both documents in your records for audit purposes</li>
    <li>Don't use proforma invoices for accounting entries</li>
    <li>Always issue regular invoices for completed transactions</li>
</ul>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>While proforma invoices and regular invoices may look similar, they serve different purposes:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Proforma Invoice:</strong> An estimate or preliminary bill sent before delivery</li>
    <li><strong>Regular Invoice:</strong> A legal document requesting payment for delivered goods/services</li>
</ul>
<p>Understanding when to use each document ensures proper business documentation, tax compliance, and accurate accounting records.</p>
