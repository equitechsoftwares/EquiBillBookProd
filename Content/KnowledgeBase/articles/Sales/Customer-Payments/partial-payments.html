<h2>Partial Payments</h2>
<p>Partial payments allow you to record payments that are less than the full invoice amount. This is common when customers make installment payments or when you receive partial payments for large invoices. EquiBillBook provides flexible options for managing partial payments.</p>

<h3>What are Partial Payments?</h3>
<p>A partial payment is a payment that covers only a portion of the total invoice amount. When you record a partial payment, the invoice status changes to "Partially Paid" and the remaining balance continues to show as outstanding until fully paid.</p>

<h3>When to Use Partial Payments</h3>
<p>Partial payments are useful in various scenarios:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Customers making installment payments for large invoices</li>
    <li>Down payments or deposits on orders</li>
    <li>Payments that don't cover the full invoice amount due to discounts or adjustments</li>
    <li>Progressive payments for long-term projects</li>
    <li>Customers paying what they can afford at the moment</li>
</ul>

<h3>Recording a Partial Payment</h3>

<h4>Step 1: Access Customer Payment</h4>
<p>To record a partial payment:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Navigate to <strong>Customers</strong> → <strong>Customer Payment</strong></li>
    <li>Click <strong>"Add Payment"</strong></li>
    <li>Select the customer who is making the payment</li>
</ol>

<h4>Step 2: Select Invoice and Enter Partial Amount</h4>
<p>When allocating the payment:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Select the invoice you want to apply the payment to</li>
    <li>Enter the partial payment amount (less than the invoice total)</li>
    <li>The system will display the invoice total and outstanding balance</li>
    <li>Enter the amount you're receiving in the payment field</li>
</ul>

<h4>Step 3: Complete Payment Details</h4>
<p>Fill in the remaining payment information:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Payment Date:</strong> Date when the partial payment was received</li>
    <li><strong>Payment Method:</strong> How the customer paid</li>
    <li><strong>Account:</strong> Account where payment is deposited</li>
    <li><strong>Reference Number:</strong> Cheque number, transaction ID, etc.</li>
    <li><strong>Notes:</strong> Add notes about the partial payment</li>
</ul>

<h4>Step 4: Save the Payment</h4>
<p>Review and save:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Verify the partial payment amount is correct</li>
    <li>Check that the remaining balance is accurate</li>
    <li>Click <strong>"Save"</strong> to record the partial payment</li>
</ol>

<h3>Invoice Status with Partial Payments</h3>
<p>After recording a partial payment:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The invoice status changes to <strong>"Partially Paid"</strong></li>
    <li>The outstanding balance is updated to show the remaining amount due</li>
    <li>The invoice remains in the accounts receivable until fully paid</li>
    <li>You can apply additional payments to the same invoice until it's fully paid</li>
</ul>

<h3>Applying Multiple Partial Payments</h3>
<p>You can apply multiple partial payments to the same invoice:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Record the first partial payment as described above</li>
    <li>When the customer makes another payment, select the same invoice again</li>
    <li>Enter the new payment amount</li>
    <li>The system will show the remaining balance and apply the new payment</li>
    <li>Continue until the invoice is fully paid</li>
</ol>

<h3>Allocating Partial Payment Across Multiple Invoices</h3>
<p>You can also split a single payment across multiple invoices:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Select multiple invoices from the outstanding invoices list</li>
    <li>Enter the payment amount for each invoice</li>
    <li>Ensure the total allocated amount equals the total payment received</li>
    <li>Each invoice will be updated with its respective partial payment</li>
</ol>

<h3>Tracking Partial Payments</h3>
<p>You can track partial payments through:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Payment History:</strong> View all payments applied to an invoice</li>

<h3>Payment Receipts for Partial Payments</h3>
