<h2>Payment Reconciliation</h2>
<p>Payment reconciliation is the process of matching payments recorded in EquiBillBook with actual bank deposits and statements. This ensures accuracy in your financial records and helps identify discrepancies, missing payments, or errors. Regular reconciliation is essential for maintaining accurate accounts receivable.</p>

    <li>Verifying that all payments received are properly recorded</li>
    <li>Identifying and resolving discrepancies</li>
    <li>Ensuring payment amounts match bank deposits</li>
    <li>Confirming that all payments are allocated to the correct invoices</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why is Payment Reconciliation Important?</h3>
<p>Regular reconciliation helps you:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Maintain accurate financial records</li>
    <li>Identify errors or fraud early</li>
    <li>Ensure all payments are recorded</li>
    <li>Match payments with bank deposits</li>
    <li>Prepare accurate financial reports</li>
    <li>Comply with accounting standards</li>
    <li>Identify outstanding payments that haven't been recorded</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to Reconcile Payments</h3>

<h4>Step 1: Gather Your Documents</h4>
<p>Before starting reconciliation, collect:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Bank statements for the reconciliation period</li>
    <li>Payment receipts and records</li>
    <li>Customer payment list from EquiBillBook</li>
    <li>Any outstanding payment records</li>
</ul>

<h4>Step 2: Generate Payment Reports</h4>
<p>In EquiBillBook, generate payment reports:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Go to <strong>Reports</strong> → <strong>Receivables Reports</strong> or <strong>Customer Payment Reports</strong></li>
    <li>Select the date range you want to reconcile</li>
    <li>Filter by payment method if needed (to match with bank deposits)</li>
    <li>Export or print the payment report</li>
</ol>

<h4>Step 3: Compare Payments with Bank Statements</h4>
<p>Match each payment:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Start with your bank statement deposits</li>
    <li>For each deposit, find the corresponding payment in EquiBillBook</li>
    <li>Verify that amounts match</li>
    <li>Check that payment dates are within the expected range</li>
    <li>Match reference numbers (cheque numbers, transaction IDs)</li>
</ol>

<h4>Step 4: Identify Discrepancies</h4>
<p>Look for:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Missing Payments:</strong> Payments in bank but not recorded in EquiBillBook</li>
    <li><strong>Unrecorded Deposits:</strong> Bank deposits with no corresponding payment record</li>
    <li><strong>Amount Differences:</strong> Payments where amounts don't match</li>
    <li><strong>Date Differences:</strong> Payments recorded on different dates than bank deposits</li>
    <li><strong>Duplicate Payments:</strong> Same payment recorded twice</li>
    <li><strong>Wrong Allocation:</strong> Payments allocated to wrong invoices or customers</li>
</ul>

<h4>Step 5: Resolve Discrepancies</h4>
<p>For each discrepancy:</p>

<h4>Missing Payments</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Record the missing payment in EquiBillBook</li>
    <li>Match it with the bank deposit</li>
    <li>Allocate it to the correct invoice(s)</li>
    <li>Add notes explaining the late entry</li>
</ul>

<h4>Amount Differences</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Check if the difference is due to bank charges or fees</li>
    <li>Verify the original payment amount</li>
    <li>Adjust the payment record if necessary</li>
    <li>Record bank charges as separate transactions if needed</li>
</ul>

<h4>Date Differences</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Update payment date if it was recorded incorrectly</li>
    <li>Consider timing differences (payment date vs. deposit date)</li>
    <li>Ensure payment dates reflect when payments were actually received</li>
</ul>

<h4>Duplicate Payments</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Identify and delete or cancel duplicate payment records</li>
    <li>Ensure only one payment record exists per transaction</li>
    <li>Verify the correct allocation is maintained</li>
</ul>

<h4>Step 6: Mark Payments as Reconciled</h4>
<p>After verification:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Mark reconciled payments in your records</li>
    <li>Maintain reconciliation documentation</li>
    <li>Note any exceptions or outstanding items</li>
    <li>Update reconciliation status for reporting</li>
</ul>

<h3>Reconciliation Methods</h3>

<h3>Manual Reconciliation</h3>
<p>For small businesses or low transaction volumes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Print payment reports from EquiBillBook</li>
    <li>Compare with bank statements manually</li>
    <li>Mark items as reconciled on paper or in a spreadsheet</li>
    <li>Resolve discrepancies one by one</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bank Statement Import (If Available)</h3>

<h3>Reconciliation Frequency</h3>
<p>Recommended reconciliation frequency:</p>
<ul>
