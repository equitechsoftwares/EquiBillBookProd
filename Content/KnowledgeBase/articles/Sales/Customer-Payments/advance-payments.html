<h2>Advance Payments</h2>
<p>Advance payments are payments received from customers before goods are delivered or services are rendered. These payments are also known as prepayments or deposits. EquiBillBook allows you to record and manage advance payments effectively.</p>

<h3>What are Advance Payments?</h3>
<p>Advance payments are payments received in advance of completing a sale or providing services. They differ from regular payments because they are not yet linked to a specific invoice. Advance payments are typically used for:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Securing orders before production or delivery</li>
    <li>Down payments for large purchases</li>
    <li>Retainers for ongoing services</li>
    <li>Pre-orders or advance bookings</li>
    <li>Security deposits</li>
</ul>

<h3>Recording an Advance Payment</h3>

<h4>Step 1: Navigate to Advance Payment</h4>
<p>To record an advance payment:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Go to <strong>Customers</strong> → <strong>Customer Payment</strong></li>
    <li>Click <strong>"Advance Payment"</strong> or select "Advance Payment" as the payment type</li>
    <li>Select the customer who is making the advance payment</li>
</ol>

<h4>Step 2: Enter Advance Payment Details</h4>
<p>Fill in the advance payment information:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Payment Date:</strong> Date when the advance payment was received</li>
    <li><strong>Payment Amount:</strong> The advance payment amount received</li>
    <li><strong>Payment Method:</strong> How the customer paid (Cash, Bank Transfer, Cheque, etc.)</li>
    <li><strong>Account:</strong> Select the account where the payment is deposited</li>
    <li><strong>Reference Number:</strong> Enter transaction reference, cheque number, or other identifier</li>
    <li><strong>Notes:</strong> Add details about what the advance is for (order reference, project name, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Step 3: Save the Advance Payment</h4>
<p>Once all details are entered:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Review the advance payment details</li>
    <li>Click <strong>"Save"</strong> to record the advance payment</li>
    <li>The advance payment will be added to the customer's account</li>
</ol>

<h3>Advance Payment Account</h3>
<p>Advance payments are typically recorded in a liability account such as:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Customer Advances</strong> or <strong>Unearned Revenue</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Deferred Income</strong></li>
    <li>A dedicated advance payment account</li>
</ul>
<p>This ensures proper accounting treatment until the advance is applied to an invoice.</p>

<h3>Applying Advance Payments to Invoices</h3>
<p>When you create an invoice for the customer:</p>

<h4>Option 1: Apply During Invoice Creation</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Create the sales invoice as usual</li>
    <li>When entering payment details, select to apply advance payment</li>
    <li>Select the advance payment(s) to apply</li>
    <li>The system will automatically deduct the advance amount from the invoice total</li>
    <li>Record any additional payment if needed</li>
</ol>

<h4>Option 2: Apply After Invoice Creation</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Create the sales invoice first</li>
    <li>Go to Customer Payments</li>
    <li>Select "Apply Advance" or create a new payment</li>
    <li>Select the invoice and choose to apply existing advance payment</li>
    <li>The advance payment will be allocated to the invoice</li>
</ol>

<h3>Multiple Advance Payments</h3>
<p>You can record multiple advance payments from the same customer:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Each advance payment is tracked separately</li>
    <li>You can apply one or more advance payments to an invoice</li>
    <li>The system tracks available advance balance for each customer</li>
    <li>You can see all advance payments in the customer's payment history</li>
</ul>

<h3>Viewing Advance Payments</h3>
<p>You can view advance payments through:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Customer Payment List:</strong> Filter by "Advance Payment" type</li>
    <li><strong>Customer Statement:</strong> See advance payments in customer statements</li>
    <li><strong>Customer Details:</strong> View advance balance on customer account</li>
    <li><strong>Reports:</strong> Generate reports showing advance payments and their status</li>
</ul>

<h3>Advance Payment Balance</h3>
<p>The system maintains an advance payment balance for each customer:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Shows total advance payments received</li>
    <li>Shows how much has been applied to invoices</li>

</ul>

<h3>Accounting Treatment</h3>
<p>Advance payments affect your accounting as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>When Received:</strong> Increases your cash/bank account and creates a liability (unearned revenue)</li>
    <li><strong>When Applied to Invoice:</strong> Reduces the liability and records the sale</li>
    <li><strong>Accounts Receivable:</strong> Advance payments reduce the net receivables amount</li>
</ul>

<h3>Best Practices for Advance Payments</h3>
