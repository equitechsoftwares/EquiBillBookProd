<h2>Creating Delivery Challans</h2>
<p>Delivery Challans in EquiBillBook are essential documents that serve as proof of delivery for goods sent to customers. They help you track shipments, manage deliveries, and maintain proper documentation before invoicing.</p>

<h3>What is a Delivery Challan?</h3>
<p>A Delivery Challan is a document that accompanies goods during shipment. It lists the items being delivered, quantities, and delivery details. Unlike invoices, delivery challans don't include pricing information and are used primarily for logistics and delivery tracking.</p>
