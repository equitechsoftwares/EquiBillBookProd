<h2>Stopping Recurring Sales</h2>
<p>There are various reasons why you might need to stop a recurring invoice. This guide explains the different ways to stop recurring sales in EquiBillBook, when to use each method, and what happens when you stop a recurring invoice.</p>

<h3>When to Stop Recurring Sales</h3>
<p>Common scenarios for stopping recurring sales include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Customer cancels their subscription or service</li>
    <li>Contract or agreement has ended</li>
    <li>Temporary pause needed (e.g., customer on hold)</li>
    <li>Price or terms need to be updated (stop and recreate)</li>
    <li>Customer requests to stop recurring billing</li>
    <li>Business decision to discontinue a service</li>
    <li>End date has been reached</li>
</ul>

<h3>Methods to Stop Recurring Sales</h3>
<p>There are several ways to stop recurring invoices, each with different effects:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Set Status to Inactive:</strong> Permanently stops invoice generation</li>
    <li><strong>Set Status to Hold:</strong> Temporarily pauses invoice generation</li>
    <li><strong>Set End Date:</strong> Automatically stops when end date is reached</li>
    <li><strong>Delete Recurring Invoice:</strong> Removes it completely (use with caution)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Method 1: Setting Status to Inactive</h3>
<p>This permanently stops the recurring invoice from generating new invoices:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Navigate to <strong>Recurring Sales</strong></li>
    <li>Select the recurring invoice you want to stop</li>
    <li>Click <strong>"Edit"</strong> or <strong>"Change Status"</strong></li>
    <li>Change the status to <strong>"Inactive"</strong></li>
    <li>Save the changes</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>What happens:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>No new invoices will be generated</li>
    <li>The recurring invoice remains in the system for historical reference</li>
    <li>Previously generated invoices are not affected</li>
    <li>You can reactivate it later if needed</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Use when:</strong> You want to permanently stop the recurring invoice but keep it for records</p>

<h3>Method 2: Setting Status to Hold</h3>
<p>This temporarily pauses invoice generation:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Navigate to <strong>Recurring Sales</strong></li>
    <li>Select the recurring invoice</li>
    <li>Click <strong>"Change Status"</strong> or <strong>"Put on Hold"</strong></li>
    <li>Set status to <strong>"Hold"</strong></li>
    <li>Save the changes</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>What happens:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Invoice generation is paused</li>
    <li>You can resume it later by changing status back to "Active"</li>
    <li>The Next Invoice Date is preserved</li>
    <li>Previously generated invoices are not affected</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Use when:</strong> You need a temporary pause (e.g., customer on vacation, service suspended)</p>

<h3>Method 3: Setting an End Date</h3>
<p>This automatically stops the recurring invoice when the end date is reached:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Edit the recurring invoice</li>
    <li>Uncheck <strong>"Never Expires"</strong> if it's checked</li>
    <li>Set an <strong>End Date</strong> to when you want it to stop</li>
    <li>Save the changes</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>What happens:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>The recurring invoice will continue generating invoices until the end date</li>
    <li>After the end date, no new invoices will be generated</li>
    <li>The status may automatically change to "Completed" or "Inactive"</li>
    <li>You can extend the end date if needed</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Use when:</strong> You know exactly when the recurring invoice should stop (e.g., contract end date)</p>

<h3>Method 4: Deleting Recurring Invoice</h3>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> This permanently removes the recurring invoice. Use with caution.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Navigate to <strong>Recurring Sales</strong></li>
    <li>Select the recurring invoice</li>
    <li>Click <strong>"Delete"</strong> or <strong>"Remove"</strong></li>
    <li>Confirm the deletion</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>What happens:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>The recurring invoice is removed from the system</li>
    <li>No new invoices will be generated</li>
    <li>Previously generated invoices remain in the system</li>
    <li>This action may be irreversible</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Use when:</strong> You're certain you'll never need the recurring invoice again and want to clean up your records</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Consider setting status to "Inactive" instead of deleting, to maintain historical records</p>
