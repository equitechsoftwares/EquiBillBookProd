<h2>Setting Up Recurring Invoices</h2>
<p>Recurring invoices allow you to automate the billing process for customers who require regular, repeated invoicing. This feature is perfect for subscription services, monthly retainers, rent collection, or any recurring billing scenario. This guide will walk you through setting up your first recurring invoice in EquiBillBook.</p>

<h3>What are Recurring Invoices?</h3>
<p>Recurring invoices are templates that automatically generate sales invoices at specified intervals. Instead of manually creating the same invoice every month, week, or day, you set it up once and the system generates invoices automatically based on your schedule.</p>
