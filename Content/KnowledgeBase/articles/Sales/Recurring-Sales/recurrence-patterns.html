<h2>Recurrence Patterns</h2>
<p>Recurrence patterns define how often your recurring invoices are generated. EquiBillBook offers flexible recurrence options to match various billing cycles. This guide explains the different recurrence patterns available and how to configure them for your business needs.</p>

<h3>Understanding Recurrence Patterns</h3>
<p>A recurrence pattern consists of three main components:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Repeat Every:</strong> The time unit (Day, Week, or Month)</li>
    <li><strong>Repeat Every Number:</strong> How many units between each invoice</li>
    <li><strong>Date Range:</strong> Start date and optional end date</li>
</ul>

<h3>Daily Recurrence Pattern</h3>
<p>Use daily recurrence for invoices that need to be generated every day or every few days:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Repeat Every:</strong> Select "Day"</li>
    <li><strong>Repeat Every Number:</strong> Enter the number of days (e.g., 1 for daily, 2 for every other day, 7 for weekly)</li>
    <li><strong>Example:</strong> Repeat Every: Day, Repeat Every Number: 1 = Daily invoices</li>
    <li><strong>Example:</strong> Repeat Every: Day, Repeat Every Number: 3 = Every 3 days</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Use Cases:</strong> Daily service charges, daily rental fees, daily subscription services</p>

<h3>Weekly Recurrence Pattern</h3>
<p>Use weekly recurrence for invoices generated on a weekly basis:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Repeat Every:</strong> Select "Week"</li>
    <li><strong>Repeat Every Number:</strong> Enter the number of weeks (e.g., 1 for weekly, 2 for bi-weekly, 4 for monthly)</li>
    <li><strong>Example:</strong> Repeat Every: Week, Repeat Every Number: 1 = Weekly invoices</li>
    <li><strong>Example:</strong> Repeat Every: Week, Repeat Every Number: 2 = Bi-weekly invoices</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Use Cases:</strong> Weekly service subscriptions, weekly maintenance fees, weekly consulting retainer</p>

<h3>Monthly Recurrence Pattern</h3>
<p>Use monthly recurrence for invoices generated on a monthly basis:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Repeat Every:</strong> Select "Month"</li>
    <li><strong>Repeat Every Number:</strong> Enter the number of months (e.g., 1 for monthly, 2 for bi-monthly, 3 for quarterly, 6 for semi-annually, 12 for annually)</li>
    <li><strong>Example:</strong> Repeat Every: Month, Repeat Every Number: 1 = Monthly invoices</li>
    <li><strong>Example:</strong> Repeat Every: Month, Repeat Every Number: 3 = Quarterly invoices</li>
    <li><strong>Example:</strong> Repeat Every: Month, Repeat Every Number: 12 = Annual invoices</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Use Cases:</strong> Monthly subscriptions, monthly rent, quarterly service fees, annual memberships</p>

<h3>Date Configuration</h3>
<p>Configure the date range for your recurrence pattern:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Start Date:</strong> The date when the first invoice should be generated</li>
    <li><strong>End Date:</strong> (Optional) The date when recurring invoices should stop</li>
    <li><strong>Never Expires:</strong> Check this box if you want the recurring invoice to continue indefinitely</li>
</ul>

<h3>How Dates Are Calculated</h3>
<p>The system calculates the next invoice date based on:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The last invoice generation date</li>
    <li>The recurrence pattern (Day/Week/Month)</li>
    <li>The repeat every number</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>If Start Date is January 1st and pattern is Monthly (1), next invoice will be February 1st</li>
    <li>If Start Date is January 1st and pattern is Weekly (2), next invoice will be January 15th (14 days later)</li>
    <li>If Start Date is January 1st and pattern is Daily (7), next invoice will be January 8th</li>
</ul>

<h3>Best Practices for Recurrence Patterns</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Choose the Right Pattern:</strong> Select the pattern that matches your actual billing cycle</li>
    <li><strong>Set Clear Start Dates:</strong> Use the first day of the billing period as the start date when possible</li>
    <li><strong>Use End Dates for Contracts:</strong> Set end dates for time-limited subscriptions or contracts</li>
    <li><strong>Review Next Invoice Date:</strong> Always verify the calculated next invoice date is correct</li>
    <li><strong>Test Before Activating:</strong> Create a draft first and review the dates before activating</li>
    <li><strong>Document Special Cases:</strong> Add notes if there are special date requirements</li>
</ul>

<h3>Special Considerations</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Month-End Dates:</strong> If you start on the 31st and use monthly recurrence, the system will handle month-end dates appropriately</li>
    <li><strong>Leap Years:</strong> The system automatically handles leap years for date calculations</li>
    <li><strong>Business Days:</strong> Currently, recurrence is based on calendar days, not business days</li>
    <li><strong>Time Zones:</strong> Dates are calculated based on your system's time zone settings</li>
</ul>

<h3>Modifying Recurrence Patterns</h3>
<p>You can modify recurrence patterns for existing recurring invoices:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Edit the recurring invoice to change the pattern</li>
    <li>The next invoice date will be recalculated based on the new pattern</li>
    <li>Previously generated invoices are not affected by pattern changes</li>
    <li>Only future invoices will use the new pattern</li>
</ul>

<h3>Troubleshooting Recurrence Patterns</h3>
<p>If invoices are not generating as expected:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Verify the recurrence pattern is set correctly</li>
    <li>Check that the recurring invoice status is "Active"</li>
    <li>Ensure the start date has passed (for the first invoice)</li>
    <li>Verify the end date hasn't passed (if an end date is set)</li>
    <li>Check that "Never Expires" is enabled if you want it to continue indefinitely</li>
    <li>Review the next invoice date in the recurring invoice details</li>
</ul>

<h3>Need Help?</h3>
<p>If you need assistance with recurrence patterns:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Review your business requirements to determine the best pattern</li>
    <li>Test different patterns with draft recurring invoices</li>
    <li>Contact support if you need help with complex recurrence scenarios</li>
