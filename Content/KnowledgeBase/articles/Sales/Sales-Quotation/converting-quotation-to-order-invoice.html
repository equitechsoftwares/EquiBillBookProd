<h2>Converting Quotation to Order/Invoice</h2>
<p>Once a customer accepts your sales quotation, you can easily convert it into a sales order or directly into a sales invoice. This feature saves time and ensures accuracy by transferring all quotation details automatically.</p>

<h3>When to Convert a Quotation</h3>
<p>Convert a quotation when:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The customer has accepted your quotation</li>
    <li>You need to create a sales order to track the order fulfillment</li>
    <li>You're ready to create an invoice for immediate billing</li>
    <li>The quotation validity period is about to expire and the customer has confirmed</li>
</ul>

<h3>Converting Quotation to Sales Order</h3>
<p>A sales order helps you track the order fulfillment process before creating an invoice.</p>

<h4>Step 1: Open the Quotation</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Navigate to <strong>Sales</strong> → <strong>Sales Quotation</strong></li>
    <li>Find and open the quotation you want to convert</li>

</ol>

<h4>Step 2: Convert to Order</h4>

    <li>Click the <strong>"Convert to Order"</strong> button (usually located at the top or bottom of the quotation)</li>
    <li>Review the conversion details in the popup or confirmation dialog</li>
    <li>Confirm the conversion</li>
</ol>

<h4>Step 3: Review the Created Order</h4>

<h4>Step 1: Open the Quotation</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Go to <strong>Sales</strong> → <strong>Sales Quotation</strong></li>
    <li>Open the quotation you want to convert</li>

</ol>

<ul>
    <li>A new sales invoice will be created with all quotation details</li>
    <li>The invoice will have a new invoice number</li>
    <li>All items, prices, taxes, discounts, and terms will be transferred</li>
    <li>The quotation status will be updated to reflect the conversion</li>
    <li>Stock will be updated if inventory tracking is enabled</li>
</ul>

<p>You can now:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Review and modify the invoice if needed</li>
    <li>Send the invoice to the customer</li>
    <li>Record payments against the invoice</li>
    <li>Print or download the invoice as PDF</li>
</ul>

<h3>What Gets Transferred During Conversion?</h3>

    <li>Adjust quantities and prices</li>
    <li>Modify discounts and charges</li>
    <li>Update terms and conditions</li>
    <li>Change dates and references</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Changes made to the order/invoice do not affect the original quotation.</p>

<h3>Conversion Status Tracking</h3>

</li>

<h3>Best Practices</h3>
<ul>

    <li>Verify that all items and prices are correct</li>
    <li>Check that stock availability if converting to invoice with inventory tracking</li>
    <li>Update quotation status appropriately to maintain accurate records</li>
    <li>Keep the original quotation for reference and audit purposes</li>

</ul>

<h3>Common Scenarios</h3>

<h4>Scenario 1: Standard Conversion Process</h4>
<p>Quotation → Order → Invoice (for businesses that need to track fulfillment)</p>

<h4>Scenario 2: Direct Billing</h4>
<p>Quotation → Invoice (for immediate billing without order tracking)</p>

<h4>Scenario 3: Partial Conversion</h4>
<p>If a customer accepts only part of a quotation, you may need to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Create a new quotation with only accepted items</li>
    <li>Or modify the converted order/invoice to remove unaccepted items</li>
</ul>
