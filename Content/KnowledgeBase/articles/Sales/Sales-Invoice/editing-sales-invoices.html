<h2>Editing Sales Invoices</h2>
<p>Sometimes you may need to make changes to an invoice after it has been created. EquiBillBook allows you to edit invoices, with some restrictions based on the invoice status and your permissions.</p>

<h3>When Can You Edit an Invoice?</h3>
<p>You can typically edit invoices in the following statuses:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Draft:</strong> Full editing allowed</li>
    <li><strong>Sent:</strong> Limited editing may be available (depending on settings)</li>
    <li><strong>Partially Paid:</strong> Limited editing (usually only certain fields)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Invoices that are fully paid or cancelled usually cannot be edited. You may need to create a credit note or adjustment instead.</p>

<h3>Editing Paid Invoices</h3>

    <li>If you need to correct errors, you may need to reverse payments first (if permitted)</li>
    <li>Consult with your administrator about the proper procedure</li>
</ul>

<h3>Edit History and Audit Trail</h3>
<p>EquiBillBook maintains a record of changes:</p>
<ul>

    <li>When changes were made (timestamp)</li>
    <li>What fields were modified</li>
    <li>Previous and new values (where applicable)</li>
</ul>
<p>This audit trail helps with compliance and troubleshooting.</p>

<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>

    <li><strong>Check invoice status:</strong> Some statuses don't allow editing</li>
    <li><strong>Verify permissions:</strong> Ensure your user role has edit permissions</li>
    <li><strong>Check payments:</strong> Invoices with payments may have restricted editing</li>
    <li><strong>Review settings:</strong> Check if editing is disabled in system settings</li>
    <li><strong>Contact administrator:</strong> If you need to edit a restricted invoice, contact your system administrator</li>
</ul>

<h3>Alternative to Editing</h3>
<p>If you cannot edit an invoice, consider:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Credit Note:</strong> Create a credit note to adjust amounts</li>
    <li><strong>Debit Note:</strong> Create a debit note for additional charges</li>
    <li><strong>Cancel and Recreate:</strong> Cancel the invoice and create a new one (if permitted)</li>
    <li><strong>Manual Adjustment:</strong> Record manual adjustments in accounting (advanced)</li>
</ul>

<p>Editing invoices is a powerful feature that allows you to make corrections and adjustments. Use it carefully, especially for invoices that have already been sent to customers or have payments recorded.</p>
