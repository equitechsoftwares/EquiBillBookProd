<h2>Tax Calculations on Invoices</h2>
<p>Accurate tax calculation is essential for compliance and proper invoicing. EquiBillBook automatically calculates taxes based on your configuration, item settings, and customer information.</p>

<h3>How Tax Calculation Works</h3>
<p>Tax is calculated automatically based on:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Item tax settings (each item can have a tax rate)</li>
    <li>Customer tax settings (customer-specific tax rules)</li>
    <li>System tax configuration (GST/VAT rates)</li>
    <li>Place of supply rules (for GST)</li>
    <li>Tax calculation method (inclusive or exclusive)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tax Types Supported</h3>
<p>EquiBillBook supports various tax systems:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>GST (India):</strong> CGST, SGST, IGST, UTGST, CESS</li>
    <li><strong>VAT:</strong> Value Added Tax</li>
    <li><strong>Sales Tax:</strong> Sales tax systems</li>
    <li><strong>Custom Taxes:</strong> Configurable tax types</li>
</ul>

<h3>GST Calculation (India)</h3>
<p>For GST, the system calculates:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>CGST + SGST:</strong> For intra-state transactions (same state)
        <ul>
            <li>Tax is split between Central GST and State GST</li>
            <li>Example: 18% GST = 9% CGST + 9% SGST</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>IGST:</strong> For inter-state transactions (different states)
        <ul>
            <li>Integrated GST applies to the full rate</li>
            <li>Example: 18% IGST</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Place of Supply</h3>
<p>The place of supply determines tax type:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Same state:</strong> CGST + SGST applies</li>
    <li><strong>Different state:</strong> IGST applies</li>
    <li><strong>Union Territory:</strong> CGST + UTGST applies</li>
    <li>System automatically determines based on customer and business location</li>
</ul>

<h3>Item-Level Tax</h3>
<p>Each item can have:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Tax rate assigned (e.g., 5%, 12%, 18%, 28%)</li>
    <li>HSN/SAC code for tax classification</li>
    <li>Tax type (GST, VAT, etc.)</li>
    <li>Tax exemption status</li>
</ul>
<p>When you add an item to an invoice, its tax rate is automatically applied.</p>

<h3>Tax-Inclusive vs Tax-Exclusive Pricing</h3>
<p>Your system may use either method:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Tax-Inclusive:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Price includes tax</li>
            <li>Example: ₹1,180 (includes ₹180 GST at 18%)</li>
            <li>Tax amount = Price × (Tax Rate / (100 + Tax Rate))</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Tax-Exclusive:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Price excludes tax</li>
            <li>Example: ₹1,000 + ₹180 GST = ₹1,180</li>
            <li>Tax amount = Price × (Tax Rate / 100)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Tax on Discounts</h3>
<p>Tax calculation after discounts:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Tax is usually calculated on the discounted amount</li>
    <li>Item discount reduces taxable amount</li>
    <li>Invoice discount reduces taxable subtotal</li>
    <li>Tax is calculated on the net amount (after discounts)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Multiple Tax Rates</h3>
<p>If items have different tax rates:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Each item's tax is calculated separately</li>
    <li>Tax amounts are summed for total tax</li>
    <li>Invoice shows breakdown by tax rate (if configured)</li>
    <li>Tax summary shows total tax by type (CGST, SGST, IGST, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tax Exemptions</h3>
<p>Some items or customers may be tax-exempt:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Items marked as tax-exempt (0% tax)</li>
    <li>Customers with tax exemption certificates</li>
    <li>Export transactions (zero-rated)</li>
    <li>Special tax exemptions based on rules</li>
</ul>

<h3>Reverse Charge Mechanism</h3>
<p>For reverse charge (if applicable):</p>
<ul>
    <li>Customer pays tax directly to government</li>
    <li>Invoice indicates reverse charge</li>
    <li>No tax collected from customer</li>
    <li>Compliance with tax regulations</li>
</ul>

<h3>Viewing Tax Breakdown</h3>
<p>The invoice typically shows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Subtotal (before tax)</li>
    <li>Tax breakdown by type (CGST, SGST, IGST, etc.)</li>
    <li>Total tax amount</li>
    <li>Grand total (subtotal + tax)</li>
    <li>Tax rates applied</li>
</ul>

<h3>Editing Tax</h3>
<p>You may be able to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Override item tax rate (if permitted)</li>
    <li>Apply different tax rate manually</li>
    <li>Remove tax for specific items</li>
    <li>Add tax to exempt items</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Tax editing may be restricted based on permissions and compliance requirements.</p>

<h3>Tax Configuration</h3>
<p>Configure tax settings in:</p>
<ul>

    <li><strong>Customer Settings:</strong> Configure customer tax preferences</li>

<h3>HSN/SAC Codes</h3>
<p>Harmonized System of Nomenclature (HSN) or Service Accounting Code (SAC):</p>
<ul>
    <li>Required for GST compliance in India</li>
    <li>Assigned to items in item master</li>
    <li>Appears on invoice for tax reporting</li>
