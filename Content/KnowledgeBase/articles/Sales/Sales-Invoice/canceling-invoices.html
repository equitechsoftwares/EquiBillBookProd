<h2>Canceling Invoices</h2>
<p>Canceling (or voiding) an invoice is necessary when an invoice needs to be invalidated due to errors, customer requests, or other business reasons. Understanding when and how to cancel invoices is important for accurate accounting.</p>

<h3>When to Cancel an Invoice</h3>
<p>Common scenarios for canceling invoices:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Invoice was created by mistake</li>
    <li>Customer requested cancellation</li>
    <li>Order was cancelled before fulfillment</li>
    <li>Duplicate invoice was created</li>
    <li>Invoice contains significant errors that cannot be corrected by editing</li>
    <li>Transaction did not proceed</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to Cancel an Invoice</h3>
<p>To cancel an invoice:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Navigate to the invoice you want to cancel</li>
    <li>Open the invoice details/view page</li>
    <li>Click the <strong>Cancel</strong> or <strong>Void</strong> button</li>
    <li>Enter cancellation reason (if required)</li>
    <li>Confirm the cancellation</li>
    <li>The invoice status will change to "Cancelled"</li>
</ol>

<h3>Cancellation Restrictions</h3>
<p>Cancellation may be restricted based on:</p>

    <li><strong>Invoice Status:</strong> Some statuses may not allow cancellation</li>
    <li><strong>Payments:</strong> Invoices with payments may need special handling</li>
    <li><strong>Permissions:</strong> User role and permissions</li>
    <li><strong>Time Limits:</strong> Cancellation may have time restrictions</li>
    <li><strong>System Settings:</strong> Cancellation rules configured in settings</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cancelling Paid Invoices</h3>
<p>For invoices that have payments:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Cancellation may require refunding payments first</li>
    <li>You may need to reverse payments before canceling</li>
    <li>Some systems require credit note creation instead</li>
    <li>Consult your administrator for the proper procedure</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cancellation Reason</h3>
<p>When canceling, you may need to provide:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Reason for cancellation (from predefined list or free text)</li>
    <li>Additional notes or comments</li>
    <li>Documentation or approval (for high-value invoices)</li>
</ul>
<p>This information is recorded for audit purposes.</p>

<h3>Impact of Cancellation</h3>
<p>When an invoice is cancelled, the system typically:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Changes Status:</strong> Invoice status becomes "Cancelled"</li>
    <li><strong>Restores Stock:</strong> Returns items to inventory (if stock tracking enabled)</li>
    <li><strong>Adjusts Customer Balance:</strong> Removes invoice amount from customer account</li>
    <li><strong>Updates Reports:</strong> Removes from active sales reports</li>
    <li><strong>Maintains Record:</strong> Invoice remains visible but marked as cancelled</li>
    <li><strong>Prevents Editing:</strong> Cancelled invoices typically cannot be edited</li>
</ul>

<h3>Stock Restoration</h3>
<p>If stock tracking is enabled:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Items are automatically returned to stock</li>
    <li>Stock levels are adjusted</li>
    <li>Stock movement history records the return</li>
    <li>Available quantity increases</li>
</ul>

<h3>Customer Balance Adjustment</h3>
<p>Cancellation affects customer account:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Outstanding balance is reduced</li>
    <li>Customer account balance is updated</li>
    <li>Accounts receivable is adjusted</li>
    <li>Payment status is cleared</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cancelled Invoice Record</h3>
<p>Cancelled invoices:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Remain in the system for record keeping</li>
    <li>Are clearly marked as "Cancelled"</li>
    <li>Show cancellation date and reason</li>
    <li>May be filtered out from standard reports</li>
    <li>Can be viewed for historical reference</li>
    <li>Are included in audit trails</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cannot Cancel - Alternatives</h3>
<p>If you cannot cancel an invoice, consider:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Credit Note:</strong> Create a credit note to reverse the invoice</li>
    <li><strong>Debit Note:</strong> For adjustments</li>
    <li><strong>Edit Invoice:</strong> If cancellation is not allowed, edit instead</li>
    <li><strong>Contact Administrator:</strong> Request cancellation from admin</li>
</ul>

<h3>Reversing Cancellation</h3>
<p>Typically, cancelled invoices:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Cannot be uncancelled/reactivated</li>
    <li>If needed, create a new invoice instead</li>
    <li>Some systems may allow reactivation (rare)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Best Practices</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Review invoice carefully before canceling</li>
    <li>Document cancellation reason clearly</li>

</ul>

<h3>Cancellation Workflow</h3>

</ul>

<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
<p>Common cancellation issues:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Cancel button not available:</strong> Check invoice status and permissions</li>
    <li><strong>Cannot cancel paid invoice:</strong> Process refund or reverse payment first</li>
    <li><strong>Stock not restored:</strong> Verify stock tracking settings and check stock movement</li>
    <li><strong>Balance not adjusted:</strong> Review customer account and reconciliation</li>
    <li><strong>Permission denied:</strong> Verify user role and cancellation permissions</li>
</ul>

<h3>Compliance Considerations</h3>
<p>Cancelled invoices are important for:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Audit trails and compliance</li>
    <li>Financial record keeping</li>
    <li>Tax reporting accuracy</li>
    <li>Internal controls</li>
    <li>Documentation of business decisions</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cancellation vs Credit Note</h3>
<p>Understand when to use each:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Cancel:</strong> Invoice was never valid (error, duplicate, etc.)</li>
    <li><strong>Credit Note:</strong> Invoice was valid but needs reversal (returns, refunds, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Follow your accounting practices and consult with your accountant.</p>

<h3>System Settings</h3>
<p>Cancellation behavior is controlled by:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Invoice settings</li>
    <li>User permissions</li>
    <li>Workflow rules</li>
    <li>Approval requirements</li>
</ul>

<p>Canceling invoices should be done carefully and only when necessary. Always document the reason and verify the impact on stock, customer balances, and financial records.</p>
