<ol>
    <li>Convert the order to invoice for the first set of items</li>
    <li>Adjust quantities to include only items for the first invoice</li>
    <li>Save the first invoice</li>
    <li>Convert the same order again for remaining items</li>
    <li>Repeat as needed</li>
</ol>

<h3>Best Practices</h3>
