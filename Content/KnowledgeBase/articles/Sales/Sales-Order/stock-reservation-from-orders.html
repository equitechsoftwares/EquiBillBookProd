<h2>Stock Reservation from Orders</h2>
<p>Stock reservation is a critical inventory management feature that ensures you can fulfill customer orders by reserving inventory when orders are created. This prevents overselling and helps you manage stock availability more effectively.</p>

<h3>Understanding Stock Reservation</h3>
<p>Stock reservation means:</p>
<ul>
    <li>When a sales order is created, the ordered quantities are "reserved" in your inventory</li>
    <li>Reserved stock is not available for other sales but remains in your physical inventory</li>
    <li>This ensures you have stock available when it's time to fulfill the order</li>
    <li>Reserved stock is released when the order is cancelled or converted to invoice</li>
    <li>Helps prevent double-selling of the same inventory</li>
</ul>

<h3>How Stock Reservation Works</h3>

<h4>Automatic Reservation</h4>
<p>When you create a sales order:</p>
<ol>
    <li>System checks if stock tracking is enabled for the items</li>
    <li>Verifies available stock quantity</li>
    <li>Reserves the ordered quantity (if stock is available)</li>
    <li>Updates available stock (available = total - reserved)</li>
    <li>Order status may affect when reservation occurs</li>
</ol>

<h4>Reservation Timing</h4>
<p>Stock reservation typically happens when:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Order status changes from "Draft" to "Pending" (confirmed order)</li>
    <li>Order is created with "Pending" status directly</li>
    <li>Order is confirmed by you or the customer</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: Draft orders usually don't reserve stock to allow flexibility during order creation.</p>

<h4>Reservation Process</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Order is created with items and quantities</li>
    <li>System checks stock availability for each item</li>
    <li>If stock is available, quantities are reserved</li>
    <li>Available stock decreases by reserved amount</li>
    <li>Reserved stock increases by the same amount</li>
    <li>Order shows reserved stock information</li>
</ol>

<h3>Viewing Reserved Stock</h3>

<h4>In Order Details</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Open any sales order</li>
    <li>View reserved quantities for each item</li>
    <li>See total reserved stock for the order</li>
    <li>Check reservation status</li>
</ul>

<h4>In Inventory Reports</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Navigate to <strong>Reports</strong> → <strong>Inventory Reports</strong></li>
    <li>View stock summary showing:
        <ul>
            <li>Total Stock</li>
            <li>Reserved Stock</li>
            <li>Available Stock (Total - Reserved)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Filter by item, location, or date</li>
</ul>

<h4>Stock Levels View</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Go to <strong>Items</strong> → <strong>Stock Levels</strong></li>
    <li>See reserved stock for each item</li>
    <li>View which orders have reserved stock</li>
    <li>Check reservation details</li>
</ul>

<h3>Stock Availability Scenarios</h3>

<h4>Sufficient Stock Available</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Ordered quantity is less than or equal to available stock</li>
    <li>Stock is reserved successfully</li>
    <li>Order can be fulfilled</li>
    <li>Available stock decreases accordingly</li>
</ul>

<h4>Insufficient Stock</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Ordered quantity exceeds available stock</li>
    <li>System may:
        <ul>
            <li>Reserve available quantity and flag shortage</li>
            <li>Show warning message</li>
            <li>Prevent order confirmation (depending on settings)</li>
            <li>Allow backorder creation</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>You'll need to:
        <ul>
            <li>Procure additional stock</li>
            <li>Reduce order quantity</li>
            <li>Cancel the order</li>
            <li>Wait for stock replenishment</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>No Stock Available</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Item is out of stock</li>
    <li>Order cannot reserve stock</li>
    <li>System will alert you</li>
    <li>Options:
        <ul>
            <li>Create backorder</li>
            <li>Cancel the order</li>
            <li>Wait for stock arrival</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Releasing Reserved Stock</h3>
<p>Reserved stock is released in the following scenarios:</p>

<h4>Order Cancellation</h4>
<ul>
    <li>When an order is cancelled</li>
    <li>All reserved stock is immediately released</li>
    <li>Stock becomes available for other orders</li>
    <li>Automatic process - no manual intervention needed</li>
</ul>

<h4>Order Conversion to Invoice</h4>
<ul>
    <li>When order is converted to invoice</li>
    <li>Reserved stock is converted to actual sale</li>
    <li>Stock is deducted from inventory</li>
    <li>Reservation is cleared</li>
    <li>This is the normal fulfillment process</li>
</ul>

<h4>Partial Fulfillment</h4>
<ul>
    <li>When only some items are delivered</li>
    <li>Reserved stock for delivered items is released and converted to sale</li>
    <li>Reserved stock for pending items remains reserved</li>
    <li>Order status updates to "Partially Fulfilled"</li>
</ul>

<h4>Manual Release</h4>
<ul>
    <li>In some cases, you may manually release reserved stock</li>
    <li>Useful if order is on hold indefinitely</li>
    <li>Should be done carefully to avoid fulfillment issues</li>
    <li>May require approval depending on settings</li>
</ul>

<h3>Multi-Location Stock Reservation</h3>
<p>If you have multiple locations/branches:</p>

<h4>Location-Specific Reservation</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Stock is reserved from the specific location/branch</li>
    <li>Each location maintains its own reserved stock</li>
    <li>Orders are fulfilled from the assigned location</li>

<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
<p><strong>Stock is not being reserved?</strong></p>

    <li>Check for system errors in stock update process</li>
    <li>Review reservation release settings</li>
    <li>Contact support if issue persists</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Available stock shows negative?</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>This may happen if reservations exceed total stock</li>
    <li>Review and cancel unnecessary reservations</li>
    <li>Check for data inconsistencies</li>
    <li>Reconcile stock levels</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Can't fulfill order even though stock shows available?</strong></p>
