                        Equitech Softwares ("us", "we", or "our") operates the https://equibillbook.com website (hereinafter referred to as the "Service").

                    <h5 class="mb-3">Free Trial Period</h5>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        We provide a 30-day extensive free trial of our services offered in the Service. Users can utilize this trial period to evaluate our services, 
                        and if satisfied, they can proceed with the purchase. If users choose to buy the services offered in the Service, 
                        it is considered an informed decision, and refunds are not applicable.
                    </p>

                    <h5 class="mb-3">Purchase Requirements</h5>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        Before purchasing, you must read all our terms and conditions and refund policy thoroughly. If a user directly purchases 
                        the services offered on the Service without utilizing the free trial, he/she must read the refund policy and 
                        terms and conditions carefully before proceeding with the purchase, as there will be no refunds once the services are purchased.
                    </p>

                    <h5 class="mb-3">Technical Support</h5>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        After purchasing the services offered on the Service, if the user encounters any issues with the software, 
                        they can contact our support team anytime through email. Our technical team will strive to resolve the issues 
                        as quickly as possible, but the purchase amount will not be refundable.
