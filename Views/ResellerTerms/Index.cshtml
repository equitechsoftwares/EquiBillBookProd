                <p class="mb-3">

                <div class="alert alert-warning mb-4">
                    <strong>Important Note:</strong> Whenever the customer makes any payment it should go to our bank account first (both online/offline payment). The reseller should not receive any payment into his personal bank account. The reseller will get his/her total commission of the entire month within the first week of next month.
