                <p class="mb-3">
                    If you already have an existing website then you can just create a menu which will redirect it to your white-label software, otherwise we will provide you few website designs from where you can choose any one and we will make it ready for you, or you can go with a design from scratch (additional cost will be charged for both cases).
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    Once that is done your White Label Reseller is ready. Generally it can take a maximum of 7 days for the completion of entire process. Don't worry we will guide you all throughout the process.

                <p class="mb-4">
                    For creating a new website is a costly matter and after creating that you need to promote and invest a lumpsome amount and it will take much time as well. Having White Label Reseller, you can just start your independent business at once without much investment.
